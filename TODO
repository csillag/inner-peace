Really should do:
 - update readme
 - Return more data about the match[es]: how far were we from expected pos
 - Allow searching with context

Later:

 - dom-text-matcher
    - fix range selection
 - DMP matcher:  
    - Improve workaround for pattern length limit issue


If nothing better to do:
 - Scroll to selection
 - Indicate the area designated by searchPath (even before searching)
 - Make the mappings listing html part a directive
