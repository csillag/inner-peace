Really should do:
 - Return a DOM range (for selection), instead of the current custom data structure
 - Solve whitespace issues
 - Solve pattern length limit issue - search for start & end, select everything in-between?

If nothing better to do:
 - Scroll to selection
 - Indicate the area designated by searchPath (even before searching)
 - Make the mappings listing html part a directive
