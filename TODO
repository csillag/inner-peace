Really should do:
 - Solve pattern length limit issue - search for start & end, select everything in-between?
 - Use [I]Frame for embedded content
 - Implement loading of different article
 - Add bootstrap

If nothing better to do:
 - Scroll to selection
 - Indicate the area designated by searchPath (even before searching)
 - Make the mappings listing html part a directive
