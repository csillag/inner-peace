Really should do:
 - Resolve difference in results between FF and Chrome
    Text: "s <br/> a test te xt"
    Pattern: "sex text"
   Current workaround takes care of this, but should think about this more.

 - Solve whitespace issues

 - Solve pattern length limit issue - search for start & end, select everything in-between?

If nothing better to do:
 - Scroll to selection
 - Indicate the area designated by searchPath (even before searching)
 - Make the mappings listing html part a directive
