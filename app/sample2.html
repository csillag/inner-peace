We are, of course, honored that you have come to spend the day here with us. We're thrilled about the opportunity to have this conversation. I'm gonna start by just giving a little bit of background on how the day's gonna go and a couple of logistics. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You probably all figured out that there are bathrooms out and to the left. And we're going to do, we're gonna basically break the day into three major chunks. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The first chunk is gonna be the talk about the economics of networks, or as Steven now calls them peer networks, and we're going to try and get into a shared understanding of you know, what those are, how they operate, what characteristics they have, what's unique about them, what the economics of those are? And Mark. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Right here. </span><span>And</span><span>&nbsp;then we're gonna talk a little bit about the conflict between networks and the existing incumbent hierarchies, where those conflicts surface and then how the hierarchies are reacting to that. That'll be probably mostly immediately after, possibly a little bit before lunch and then immediately after lunch. And then we'll end the day talking about the degree to which networks can defend themselves in the political sphere. The techniques we've begun to see with the PIPA/SOPA debate and other things that, you know, we have collectively seen around the table that might actually create an opportunity for the networks to punch above their weight, given the fact that they're somewhat disadvantaged in the political sphere today. So we'll end the day with some beer and wine here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We've invited a number of the CEO's some of our portfolio companies to come join us for that. So you'll have a chance to talk to some people who are running networks. So that's the basic background about how the day's going to go. I'll start off by saying that I am probably maybe some of the rest of you are too a little bit uncomfortable and perhaps even a little intimidated by the fact that we've got mics here and and we've got a video camera going. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There's a reason for that. And the reason for that is that when we've done events like this in the past the conversations have been so meaty and constructive, that we felt that, you know, we'd like to make sure that other people had an opportunity to participate in those conversations and to understand what was happening there. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In the past, the way we've done it is by sharing a transcript of the conversation. So that's obviously less in your face and less intimidating, but in the world that we live in now, it feels like creating an asset that could be used by anybody who is promoting this agenda of the empowerment of networks would be the right thing to do. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So, that's what we're doing. It means that the conversation is completely on the record and so don't tell us about any new product plans or any secret ideas that you have, 'cause they are not secret. But it does mean that everything that you say is a contribution to the broader conversation. It's a way of including anyone who's interested in this set of issues. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Hey, Beth, you're right over here, next to John. And so we're really very appreciative of that. So let's, I mean, there's a lot of ways to start this conversation, and obviously everybody here has been thinking about these set of issues. But I do want to spend some time really digging in up front to kind of a definition of what these networks are, what the characteristics of them are? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I</span><span>&nbsp;mean, obviously I think all of us would sort of agree that Wikipedia or Kickstarter or Twitter is in some new form of economic organization. And we have some ideas about what kind of organization that is. And we have some ideas about where the power of those organizations come from. But, you know, when we pushed it a little bit further, we start to think, well, are there other, you know, is Facebook, was Facebook once a pure network? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Is it still a peer network? Is it evolving in a different direction? How do we know, you know, how do we define that? I actually really kinda like Nick Grossman's definition of peer networks, they're the ones that make kinda go "ahh", like Etsy makes you go “ahh” -- but that's you kinda you go, "ahh". Amazon you might go "err". But, you know, so there's, that's probably not a useful definition, but it's a way to think about it. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There's Stephen in his new book, in which he shared a chapter with us, talks about the importance of network density and some of these and the fact that we now have a medium that allows us to achieve that density is critical. But, rather than me trying to, you know, outline all of this. I'd like to get into a conversation here about, you know, what a peer network is and maybe the way to start, and I'm sorry to do this Yochai, but you coined the term peer production, and maybe if you could give us a couple minute, summary of what you think of as the network and what the characteristics of those networks are, that would be a great way to start. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.8ro8y0n2dkpm"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Yochai Benkler: </span><span>You could have given me five minutes. </span><span>What</span><span>&nbsp;I think underlies the set of concerns, considerations, affordances, reconfigurations of power that we that would together give us this “ahh” that Nick described, is the, a class of ways of connecting people and acting together that allows distributed people without necessarily preexisting relations, certainly without preexisting organizations to come together and act effectively on a goal that they either share or define together in the process of doing so, so that it contrasts with the twentieth century industrial model of relatively centralized organization, of harnessing material resources, harnessing, structuring organizational resources, then collecting human resources, identifying a goal in a relatively centralized way and then managing these people to arrive at that goal. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>At each of these layers, the collecting of the capital, the structuring of the organization, the coming together of people, the definition of the goals, and then the assignment or allocation of tasks over the course of trying to achieve that goal are done not in the centralized ex-anti-ex-post model, but rather dynamically by people joining and self-selecting into the framework and then self-selecting into the governance and leadership. And that's in a very stylized form. The thing that connects the many, many, many diverse, non-ideal forms of the network form. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The</span><span>&nbsp;reason that's important is because if we are here today for one reason at least that we're here today is that it seems like 2012 has been the year in which the network has come of age politically between the SOPA PIPA battle at the beginning of the year after and its failure, let alone the prior year in the Arab spring where it's more ambiguous how much was played by the network and how much was played by existing social networks. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But this was really the year of network politics fighting for itself. And so this moment requires that we understand not only what networks are but also what networks are against and what networks are threatened by. And that's why I wanted this particularly stark definition between twentieth and twenty-first century, or industrial hierarchical and network. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">John Perry Barlow:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It's even older than that. &nbsp;I think it's, you know, it's the vertical versus the horizontal, you know. And it's come to a head. Maybe it's monotheism versus pantheism. Then they both have to win. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>// Could you speak up? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">JPB: </span><span>Sorry. I will. Yes, it's the vertical versus the horizontal. It's monotheism versus pantheism, it's derived authority horizontally versus imposed authority from on top. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And we would be unwise to give up some of that imposed authority but we're going to have to make a lot of room for ourselves to have derived authority on the horizontal plane.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So you both mentioned both way. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Clay Shirky: </span><span>This is a passage in your textbook that I want to, well, the network that I want to pull up. And that gets, I think to what you said about economic models. Yochai goes through domestic relations between a married couple and tries to derive everything they do for one another as SIC codes as created by the federal government, some one is a dishwasher and some one else is a cook. And you know, and the absurdity piles on the absurdity, it's a beautiful passage. </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.wycp8g3n37hd"></a><span>But</span><span>&nbsp;one of the things that it says I think this "ah!" sense of these networks is they're not, there are economic ramifications from these networks, but they are not primarily modeled economically. They are mainly modeled on social relations between the participants. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I mean, Wikipedia's famous fights to even have an economic model adequate with hosting needs shows you how far afield you can get from just a purely economic structuring of these. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So in, a lot of these networks it is the implementation layer for behavioral economics in a way, which is to say there are domains of cash transaction and there are domains of human association. &nbsp;And there are ways to combine those things so the cash transactions destroy the human associations. And there are ways to combine those things. The cash transactions support the human associations, right? Flickr, you know, Flickr hitting on Flickr Pro is a way of saying everybody wants everybody's photos to be free, and small group people are willing to come forward. It's not an economic model you would have thought of until you had this notion that there are social relations to be hosted, but not to be taken advantage of in a completely extractive way. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think that one of the greatest sources of tension between the incumbent industries and these networks is the non-commoditizable nature of human relations inside these networks</span><span>&nbsp;and I've never seen it better described than in this SIC code passage in wealth of networks, </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>but I think that's a big part of the political and economic fight that we faces is asserting a set of models that respect social relations outside the completely co-modified sphere.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>Absolutely, you know, I think one of the ways in which the incumbents are threatened is that they are now competing in a way that they really have one hand tied behind their back. I mean, if somebody is pursuing a passion project on Kickstarter or creating things that they love to do on Etsy, they're working for a set of economics that are entirely different than the industrial process, and the industrial process has a very hard time competing with that set of economics. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So, and understanding the role that other human motivations play, and maybe that's what John's talking about in terms of the horizontal and what those are is, I think, an important part of this. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>(Can I say one more thing?)</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Sure, absolutely.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.bhr96if8ga1r"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Steven Johnson: </span><span>So one other thing I would add to that is - and this is something I've been wrestling with for a while and I'm still not sure how I feel about it. It seems to me there's kind of a macro distinction that's worth making it. We've seen tremendous success in these peer network structures at generating kind of group energy, amorphous, kinda protest-style kind of energy, that is not not terrifically focused but is wonderfully leaderless and capable of changing the world just by kind of, it's expression of will or excitement or protest. And then we've seen these much more kind of focused projects, where the group is actually making decisions and choices and actually building something very kind of concrete, all the stuff that Yochai has written about peer production and open sources is probably, you know, have founding example of that, the Wikipedia, and then these new developments, whether it's Kickstarter, whether it's 311, where the larger group is able to kind of actually go out and solve problems in a very kind of concrete and focused way. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I think that they are different enough that it is worth keeping them distinct in our heads, and the metaphor I use is peer networks are really good at swarming and they can be good at steering, but it's trickier to steer. It's trickier to get that diverse, decentralized group to actually focus one) &nbsp;on what the problem is and then figure out what the solution is and then implement that -- that takes a lot more than to create like a mob energy. And I say "mob" not necessarily in a critical way. The mob energies are important too. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But I think the two are different enough that it's worth kind of having them as two kinda polarities that are out there.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><h2 class="c1"><a name="h.iareq3aoq54u"></a><span>Leadership in Peer networks</span></h2><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.vv80v3a4la2f"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c11">Fred Wilson:</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">Do these peer networks, by definition not have an identified leader? One of the issues Brad always draws this great picture of a hierarchical model where information flows all the way up the hierarchy to some decision maker and then the decision flows all the way back down.

I think we were all off feeding off each other, and working the problem in a very, sort of chaotic, but powerful way. And so, I wonder if that is actually a defining characteristic of these emerging networks.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c11">Clay Shirky: </span><span class="c11">We'd have to kick Linux out of our examples if we wanted to do that and a lot of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c11">Fred Wilson: </span><span class="c11">And Wikipedia too?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c11">Clay Shirky: </span><span class="c11">Not Wikipedia. I think not Wikipedia, in fact they defenestrated famously one of their two founders within months of information, but for open-source projects, I mean, Guido Van Rossum's title is "benevolent dictator for life" over at Python, so it's not exactly a kind of touchy, feely democratic sentiment expressed in that title, </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">but they lead in a different way. Somebody once asked Linus where Linux was going and he said "Visualization, evidently." I'm not interested in it, but its what people what we're doing with it, so I can't stop it. But I think by the time we go all the way to saying, "Oh, Linux is a leaderless operation," we're either telling an untruth about Linux or kicking a lot of open source projects out of our example set that strike me as being things we'd like to talk about. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c11">Andy Weissman: </span><span class="c11">But leaderless doesn't mean directionless though. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c11">Clay Shirky: </span><span class="c11">No, but I think you would be hard pressed not to call Linus or Guido or Matts, or the people at the top of these other research projects, leaders of those projects. They're not the bosses, not the employers, but they, you know. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">(This is Yancy, how do you - These founders, in other word, is kind of that </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">these organization happens Stephen Johnson pick)</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c11">Steven Johnson: </span><span class="c11">They have founders, and so the founders are there, in some cases, not always, but they're there as, you know, people that embody a certain ethos of the organization or the spirit of it but they're not leaders and that they're not ultimate decision makers or actual depiction. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c11">Tiffiniy Cheng: </span><span class="c11">I</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;don't think it is founders. </span><span class="c11">I think it is drivers because I think you can put out a message. That then the public or people really gravitate to and not if the public really loves it, they'll rally around it. And so there was a point where something was introduced by someone. And that sort of led or became a point where people congregated around. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">And that's not leaderless.

I mean, my first trip to Congress, I asked our technology what I should make my best arguments around, whether I should talk about censorship or whether I should talk about entrepreneurship. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">And they very wisely guided me towards entrepreneurship. And I actually cherry-picked some of my best phrases from hacker news comments -- thanks Joel Spolsky -- to use in the media. I think the best leaders in these movements are the ones who know that they aren't really leading it, but instead just taking the best from everyone else.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">(Yeah.)</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c11">Bram</span><span class="c8 c11">&nbsp;Cohen: </span><span class="c11">This is Bram Cohen, software is a little bit special, because the leader of a software project isn't really a leader of a movement. They're actually doing a very technical thing. And a lot of people are surprised at me thinking that I'm a part of some broader community who uses my software, which actually I'm not. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">I'm much more interested in getting bits from point A to point B as a purely technical challenge that I find interesting than I am in what people actually do with that. So you get these software projects where the people at the center of it are doing a technical thing. That's very, very hard to do and the economics of software are such that it really doesn't make any sense to have any duplication here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">There's no sense in having two different providers who are both making things. It's just 100% duplicated work. It's like two different people making widgets, both of whom have factories that are making them at about the same cost. Software is, basically, always a natural monopoly, and you see that in interesting ways where the difference between proprietary and open-source turns out to not be all that much. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">You look at Google Chrome and Firefox. And they have basically the exact same business model.

And, you know, and </span><span class="c11">I guess there's a question of leaders and then is there a different kind of leadership. I think a lot of the comments are, there's leadership in all these projects. It doesn't mean that there's the same hierarchical leader. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">I guess, you know, one thing I would say, you know, existed in the history of Mozilla but I think most of the projects and companies like Etsy or Flickr or whatever that peer production is evident in, is either two kinds of leadership. One is some or some set of magnetic pieces that other people can build on. So whether that's Linus and Linux or whether that's the service that is there with Etsy, there's something that gives people a head start, that then they can go and take it towards virtualization, or they can go and take it towards, you know, something other than knitting, and so that piece of leadership is a magnetic thing that people wanna come and jump on top of and use for whatever purpose they want. &nbsp;I think is a critical piece of leadership to locate across all of this stuff and that's part of what Tiffiniy is talking about in terms of the message. But I think usually it's something pretty tangible that has immediate utility but also is incomplete. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">And then the other thing you see I think pretty typically but not all the time is a role of leadership around creating rule sets. And, you know, Wikipedia is sort of famous for this, but it exists there. In Mozilla, it certainly exists there as setting up any peer production based business. And an interesting thing to look at, is the role of those rule sets in relationship to effectively keeping the people who are contributing happy. &nbsp;Cause I think, that's the thing that's interesting to go back to, you know, some of Clay and Yochai’s first pieces, you can't commoditized the people who are, or, you commodotize the people who are contributing to the stuff at your peril. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And you have to do so carefully. And I also wonder as we get to the end of the afternoon whether the same same is true about politicizing the people who are in these networks. &nbsp; And that's something which actually has been harder if you look at the last 20 years, than even commoditizing these networks, is people love that feeling of "ah." They don't wanna go to Washington. They don't wanna think about TCP/IP. They don't wanna think about another trial. So that's the thing that really the important thing to look at is it's just as fraught to think about how we politicize all of the "aah" out there and the use the things of how we commoditiz`e all of the "ah" out there.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Jeff.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jeff</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Jarvis </span><span>I just finished a wonderful book called The Institutional Revolution by Douglas Allen, which he tries to look back at the rationale behind seemingly senseless institutions of English history like aristocracy and dueling and paying for army commissions and so on and so on. And he found an economic base to that, that before there was measurement and a means to measure the performance of your people who were working for you, you had to have some hostage capital of their trust. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So you built huge mansions, you've sent your daughter to court and if you screw up, you're not gonna see her again. But anyway, these argues that the institutions obviously trail the change that is then caused. Right? And these institutions - and I can't say this as well as Clay can- will try to - what's the line?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Clay Shirky: </span><span>Preserve the problem to which they are the solution.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jeff Jarvis: </span><span>Thank you very much.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I wish Woody Allen like I could just have him with me all the time and come out. So, I think we look at now and what I'm struggling with is I don't think the Internet is an institution. And I think one of our problems is we are looking at it as an institution, and that's what's dangerous. That puts it in danger. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It was Doc Searles who told me not to call it a medium some time ago, because it puts in danger there. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Where?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Well, yeah, or a place where I'm not sure what. Well, I quoted, thanks to Beth from the CTO of the Veterans Administration called it The Eighth Continent. And when I had the temerity at the EGA mentioned that to Sarkozy, he liked it too much. With the vision of putting his flag in. So the problem I have is, I think we are creating new institutions, institutions that exist is that are challenged by this, but the Internet itself --I think it's dangerous to look at it and try to understand it. And then the next question is, friends, our networks institutions. Well they can act like it, but they don't have to be. The hashtag is a platform for self-discerning groups to come together - witness Occupy Wall Street - and is that an institution? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Well, it starts to act like one, but maybe it's not. Maybe it's something new.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>So we've jumped a little bit. Yeah-- Tim</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><h2 class="c1"><a name="h.lf0zmbae39i3"></a><span>Economics of networks</span></h2><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c8"></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.a4ha6yqruwqp"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;O’Reilly:</span><span>&nbsp;I wanted to just throw out a point that was going back and forth of discussion of leadership to one to something that Steven said about economics and networks. I'd like to discuss some point in the day and that is,</span><span class="c20">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">it seems to me that the economics and networks are almost or let me put it this way, are very often not realized by the people who create the networks. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">They are created by people who solve the problem that the network has unearthed. You know, so, you think about Tim Burnsley creates the web. We all collectively create the web. One of the great probably far more than open source after the collective web is the greatest peer production system we've built, and look at who has monetized it. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">You know, people who found problems that the web did not solve or that it created, like search. You know, they found ways to actually deal with something that the network didn't do and so hey, it might be worthwhile as we think about networks and the future of networks to ask ourselves what they fail at, you know, because that will tell us something about what organization is going to develop on top of. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Nick</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Grossman: </span><span class="c7">And that's actually one thing we've been talking about and this is Nick Grossman, in trying unpack the difference between networks that make you feel safe and ones that make you say, "Err". And to some extent, I think it's where the value's captured and who's realizing that value. And we think about the difference between Etsy and the iPhone platform, say, or Amazon. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">And I don't know that there's a clear answer on this, but there's something about the values that are baked into that network, but then also where the economics of that network are realized.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Brad</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span class="c7">There's also an issue of the governance of that network.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">(Right.)</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">If you feel empowered by the network, then you tend to support it and encourage it and invest in it and contribute to it. If you feel controlled by it, you tend not to and I think that's also related to where the economics is captured. And I think this is an evolving thing. </span><span>And to come all the way back to Yochai’s point, you know, that I think, and maybe to Steven's a little bit, Steven describes these two kinds, you know, the kind of network that can create emotion and enthusiasm and momentum around maybe stopping something and the one that can actually have a proactive agenda that's defined and coordinated, there probably needs to be two different kinds of governance systems. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And the tricky part about the coordination is that as I think Mark was saying, if you get to a point where, you know, you're over-organizing, then people feel disempowered and they leave. And so there's some balance there and there's maybe a way of slicing that or a dimension through which we can look at this that would give us a better understanding of what is actually happening. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><h2 class="c1"><a name="h.ouhlxxwqw3wg"></a><span>Two layers: open network layer / peer production layer</span></h2><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jamie Boyle:</span><span>&nbsp;J</span><span class="c19">aime Boyle. I think it might be useful for us to distinguish between what I think are two levels discussions. One is a discussion about preserving the open web as a environment, as a platform, on top of which all kinds of amazing things can happen, innovation, social connections, political activism, destruction of income and business model, and so forth. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">And then the second is the kind of peer production which Yochai talks about which is also implicated in the baseware, but where you can create new networks and one the reasons we love the open web is because people can set up more networks on it. And we think that that ability and that those networks represent a vision of human possibility that has not been adequately captured in our economics or our business models or our ways of thinking -- and all of us to some extent have drunk that Kool-Aid -- and think that this makes us human or allows a form of humanity which we care about for political reasons and for creative reasons and sometimes just for economic reasons and we think that if the open web didn't exist, then that thing, that kind of activity, would happen much less and in fewer interesting ways. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c19"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">And so it's actually really hard even to get people to understand the first problem, that is to say, preserve the open web. Don't destroy the DNS system, etc., etc. Don't turn computers back into terminals, right? Let alone to get them to understand the second level, which is the, no, there's this kind of cool peer production stuff which is actually something you've seem but maybe not named as such that you should think about in deeper ways but to me those seem like separate layers of a conversation that we can merge if we want. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Steven</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Johnson:</span><span>&nbsp;I think that's a great point. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I also like what Tim said, and maybe I can just connect them here. Anticipating the emergence of network politics discussions and kind of third act here. </span><span>One of the things that this group is going to, and the people around us, you know, is going to and already has been accused of is kind of naive cyber Utopianism, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I think there is two ways around it. The first is I think it is very important to spend time thinking about what Tim was pointing out, which is the existing platforms, whether it's the Internet itself or the web, are not perfect, right? And there is a tendency to think about the architecture of the Internet as this kind of sacred test. And, you know, if we mess with it in any way because it was perfect. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And everything should look like the Internet and be structured like the Internet. And God knows the Internet is extraordinary, but there are flaws in it and there are some things that it does very poorly and some things maybe architecture could have been done better at. As we should be, you know, remind ourselves that those things exist and a part of our advocacy in the world is to kind of point out every now and then that the Internet does have flaws like everything else. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Secondly, to point out that we're not saying is that progress and social change is gonna come from sticking the Internet on everything, but rather from using Internet as a role model, as a metaphor for the way that we should structure organizations and communities and interactions. It often will not about to a technology at all. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I think we keep our eyes on both those kind of distinctions. We can kind of skirt some of those critics.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.zepwat9wn9b9"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c20 c8">John</span><span class="c20 c8">&nbsp;Perry Barlow: </span><span class="c20">Let me say something quickly, and then I'll shut up. Well, for awhile. Years ago, I was addressing a bunch of bank CEO's, major bankers, several members of the Federal Reserve Board, and I asked them if they had a minute to decide whether they would give up all of their assets, public and private, I mean, corporate and personal, and all of their relationships, which would they chose? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c20"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20">And nobody went with their assets. Because everybody understood that they could rebuild their assets from their relationships, but not the other way around. And I said, "Well, why do you go on placing so much emphasis in economic theory on the thing that is less important to you?" And one of them said, "Because as we can measure it. “</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c20"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c20">Now, I think we're actually reaching the point where we can start to measure relationships. In some quantitative way.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jeff Jarvis: </span><span>But that the institutional revolution points exactly that the measurement is what changed those institutions. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><h2 class="c1"><a name="h.k0xdm3wn9y1z"></a><span>How the net is changing the role of individuals &amp; institutions</span></h2><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.b30hxw2vrbh1"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Naomi</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Wolf: </span><span>Can I jump onto what Steven Johnson said? It's Naomi Wolf speaking. So I think it's sort of powerfully important to recognize, as everyone here is doing, the values and relationship, the value in an alternative model of organization. But I kind of want to add from my experience, which is not from the tech sector bits of grooming, using the Internet to groom activists on a grass roots level, that another piece of value which makes this entity much more threatening and makes the immediate future a much sharper escalation of conflict, and we might even be so willing to recognize is that an additional value and it goes to why the issue of leadership came up so early, and a new kind of leadership is that </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.litf2r4zyl0h"></a><span class="c2">the Internet is training people to think differently about themselves, and to create, and it's re-patterning their brains in terms of their own self-concept. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And what I mean is, you know, everybody now knows or is beginning to know that they have the ability or the mandate or the potential to become a journalist, a politician, a grassroots leader of their community, a documenter of government abuses, and so on and so on. So, what this does, I guess what I'm jumping in to say is that I think it's important to recognize that conditioning because it's gonna have that's why 2012 has been a year of attack on the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It's gonna happen really, really fast, because what happens - these things are related - as more and more people start seeing themselves as the generators of leadership, and these various ways. It's draining value, including economic value, out of institutions and narratives that won't exist anymore, you know, in five years</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span>and just one quick example is the narrative of war, you know, online people all over the world are realizing there's no enemy, there's no real global gigantic enemy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Most people want to live in reasonable peace and sustainability. They're seeing how similar they are on Facebook and so on across ethnic and racial and party boundaries, and so all of the gatekeepers can profit from the narrative of leadership of country, of ethnicity, of hostility of giant arms races. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It's like the end of the Wizard of Oz. And so, I guess what I'm just wanting to say is that </span><span class="c2">we're not gonna have much space unless we organize quickly to resist the people whose value is gonna be drained out by this growth in individualistic leadership at a grassroots level for long, unless we organize it -- which is why I’m glad this conference exists.

And that situation has evolved over the centuries to where our leaders we don't trust. Mostly we don't know them. We don't have any direct interaction with them. And I think what I've seen with the Internet over the, you know, since the beginning of the Internet, I started to naturally devolve that leadership. We're able to develop relationships no longer based on geography, but based on common interest, that common philosophy. </span><span>We're able to develop a level of trust with people we've actually never met, which is pretty extraordinary, you see that with the advent of online dating services, right, extraordinary numbers of people are meeting online, developing enough trust to actually get together in the offline world and build genuine relationships. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So I think we're seeing this devolution of leadership to the individual level and I think that's the healthiest thing we can do in society. </span><span class="c0">People often argue that we have come so far from the days of the founders that maybe those ideas aren't relevant anymore. I would argue that based on the web, we are entirely more close to the way communities were built and organized back then than we have been ever before in history.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span>So, it's really interesting. It's not of that economy that both of these things existed at once. The notion that there's a kind of relationship that could have historically only existed in a small community, that now exists globally. As a result of this median, I guess I cant call it medium. Jeff has in the economy world. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So Jamie was talking a little bit about you know, the two levels that we're talking about, the open web and then the. I guess we're really talking about three levels. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I should start at the bottom. Open web is a platform and then there's a series of networks on top of the platform. And then there's the series of problems that haven't been solved that Tim was talking about that are creating opportunities for new networks that either exist around or on top of. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim O’Reilly: </span><span>No. Actually, I didn't say there were new networks. I actually said there are new non-network players about the networks. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>Non-network players.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I actually think.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>Non-network players, you think they would be organized? How do you define the difference, are they organized hierarchally or are they organized as a more traditional business venture?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;O’Reilly: </span><span>I don't know if I've thought it through, but it seems to me that what we see almost always on top of networks are new kinds of aggregations, which do create new hierarchies. I think the two are in a kind of dialectic. Yeah, I mean the web created Google. You know, and then, you know, you look at where we are right now --I mean, we have some very, very powerful layers that are not run by network principles that draw from and are on top of these networks.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: `</span><span>Well, so, Facebook is a really interesting example, right? Because it's, I would argue that it probably is a network, but its governance system.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Is you know, is not the one that Yochai was describing as being produced by the participants. The governance system is derived from, you know, the fact that they have a dominant network effect, which gives them a great deal of market power. And then they can sort of dictate what the rules are, and I think, that is what begins to shift that actually for the participants. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so, you know, one thing we could spend at many talking about is that the nature of the governance of these networks and the degree to which I mean I'm not really. Is Reddit a completely. It's not. It's not a democracy but to some degree some of these networks are actually governed by the design principles of the network and by nothing else, which is a really interesting potential model because you could define a set of design principles that create some behaviors that aren't their emergent not completely contolled, but there are examples of working networks that are in Steven's words, that the type two networks that are making proactive progress or change in some way that are organized as a pure democracy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><h2 class="c1"><a name="h.8a7w88xzm8fp"></a><span>Leadership</span></h2><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c8"></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.p9wduxtwjdo7"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Larry</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Lessig: </span><span>This is Larry Lessig. </span><span>I wanna push back a little bit on that question but, </span><span class="c11">I think we should think a little bit more about what we mean by leadership. All right, so, you know, think about the leadership necessary to name a street Main Street, versus the leadership necessary to get soldiers in Gallipoli to throw themselves into the middle of a fight. Right? Both are examples of leadership, let's call this main street, you know, risk your life, go into a useless fight. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">But the difference between them is how much we're actually calling on people to do, and I think this leads back to something Steven writes about and he thinks about, the nature of simultaneous innovation. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">You know we have this reality that appears at times, major innovations happen simultaneously. Everybody is thinking about the same thing at the same time. And that it feels to me is more like naming Main Street. It's like we're all brought to a point where we all come to see something as the next amazing thing to do, and then seven of us do it all across the world at the same time, but it's not as significant as out of the blue thinking of something that's radically different and radically new. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">And I think the kind of leadership we're talking about right now is more like naming Main Street, more like simultaneous innovations that happen in the context of invention in the sense that the amazing things that happen is when, you know, society is brought to a place that we're all pretty close and it just takes a tiny spark to get a large number of people to recognize what exactly they're feeling already. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">I think, you know, your movement, TheTea Party Movement is an example of that. It wasn't cold water or Regan, right? It wasn't somebody standing up I'm trying to move a political class from, you know, three points to the left and center, to seven points to the right of center. It was, there's a whole bunch of people, they're almost there and it just took a couple people to put stuff out on list for that spark to happen. Now what I think is that in this network space, the kind of leadership we're talking about is always going to be leadership like that and the kind of temptation of imagining that we're gonna stand up and get people to jump into Gallipoli is that's the romantic conception we have from the 20th century, it's just not the way the world is gonna be in the 21st.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yancy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.olltsbfyo1iu"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Yancey</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Strickler: </span><span>Yeah. Yancy from Kickstarter. I mean, </span><span class="c2">maybe what's happening right now is that this is a new kind of great migration where there are increasing people every day who feel first and foremost they are citizens of the Internet. And that is its own society. It has its own rules. And it's a society where authorship and ownership are very different. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And there's ways in this clashes but the other world been engaged with which is the countries we live in and the communities we're a part of. And you know, we know where that's going yet. But there are clearly different rules to it. And, you know, being a citizen of the Internet is way more satisfying than being a citizen of whatever country because there is actually response to you. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You know? There is feedback, there's positive feedback. You can see the change that you have. You can see the impact that you have. You feel more connected through all these things. </span><span>And so, I think that that brings about a lot of changes, and one of those is that we can be lead by ideas, you know, we don't meet people, ideas can meet, and when authorship is such a nebulous thing. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You know, I don't know who first created the 99% movement, I don't know who first created The Tea Party Movement. These are things that just came about. There was, there was an origin. Maybe it was a conversation over beer, maybe it was a very planned out conscious idea, but they entered culture and it didn't matter anymore. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>They were just ideas for people to sign on to. And, you know, I think we're willing to do that if can see ourselves in them, and they feel like they have some meaning to us into our lives.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Naomi</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Wolf:</span><span>&nbsp;Yancy, can I say. It's Naomi speaking. In an ideal world, that process would continue. I'm sorry to keep you, Cassandra, but the challenges that, I mean, look at Occupy just to use a real life example. It's very, very difficult to write about them, to get a quote, to have them negotiate with people and, you know, act up on the other hand had a really empowered leadership model. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>They were extremely effective but they understood looking back at other successful civil rights movements, that you need the Grassroots opposition. The Tea Party knows this too, and that doesn't devalue the role of, you know, don't call them a leader, a messenger, a representative, a spokesperson, or a communicator, both to communicate the message and to be there to do a deal with the stakeholders. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I mean, guess what I'm nervous about? And we haven't maybe I need to save this for section three. But </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.7mof5pczfcu"></a><span class="c2">what's really alarming to me is that the radical implications of what we're talking about here which is so beautiful is so threatening to the people who have the power right now to stomp out the unlead vital generative group. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And they are organized, and they do have leaders, and they do have resources that I think it's dangerous if you wanna protect this, to go forward without thinking about, well can we create maybe using things like Act Up or, you know, the civil rights movement. But new models of leadership that are empowering but that can fight in a real politic world that is oppositional to it.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Yancey</span><span class="c8 c2">&nbsp;Strickler:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Well, I think that if any of us could put down money on either the web or institutions for our future, you know, what will eventually win. I think we all see that it's the web and the places that we're having where there's a conflict are the ways of interacting on the web thatmake a lot the decentralization has collectively decided to do things together. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Those are not things that translate as well into the physical world that we're in right now. But I don't know if that would always be true. I don't know if that will always be true. I don't know if that's an assumption that we can make.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I mean, not to. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Brad</span><span class="c8 c2">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span class="c2">You made a point and I think that I might disagree that it's not a slam dunk that the web wins. I actually agree with you.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I think the web does win. I think it's like grass growing up through the pavement. Eventually it wins. And the question that we have to think about is does it win in one generation or two or three, and it feels like the objective that all of us should take on as our own objective is to see if we can reduce that.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Yancey: </span><span class="c2">But even right now it's been less than 10 years basically for this to have taken really the holds and mainstream society that it has. This happened very quickly. I agree that it's honest slam dunk.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Brad: </span><span class="c2">I would argue, and Naomi would argue that, I should caution about that, but I think also, for the first 10 years it was kind of apolitical, and nobody really recognized the threat. And now as institutions begin to recognize the threat, I think you can expect a more significant reaction.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Tim</span><span class="c8 c2">&nbsp;O’Reilly: </span><span class="c2">I think that the notion that networks replace institutions is incredibly naive. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.hmg8yi1ei82e"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Networks destroy existing institutions and then new institutions are created on top of them. Just like Troy, you know, layers on layers. And I think we're going, you know, to me the really interesting question is, how are we going to make better institutions after the revolution is over or, you know, as the revolution is going on. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You know, if you think about the American Revolution versus the French Revolution, then you have a really great example where, you had one that had a lot of forethought about, let's try to build some new institutions on top of this network uprising. Relatively speaking to the power structures of the day, and you had another one that didn't really think about it, and it very rapidly fell back into something that resembled what had existed before. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And I think we're.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">(And then the third republic)</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That's right. Yeah. So, I think the real challenge is not to try to imagine some utopia in which the network works completely different way is to say, "Okay, how do we harness the energy of the network and channel it into institutions that preserve as much of it as possible?"</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Albert Wenger: </span><span>Is</span><span>&nbsp;that the same question as what kind of rules should you be. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>What kind of rules should networks be self-imposing? Is that the same question? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim: </span><span>Yeah in some ways, in some ways. But I mean, but it really is the challenge of institutionalizing networks. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>To me it seems to be very much at the heart. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Bram Cohen: </span><span>I</span><span>'m not feeling quite so utopian about the rise of networks, because while Grassroots Movements have gotten that much more sophisticated in terms of their ability to self organize. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The techniques for astroturfing have commensurately gotten stronger as well and techniques for co-opting these movements and misdirecting them have as well and that's a lot of why Occupy Wall Street officially has no leaders. It's because it doesn't want to get co-opted. And the best way to do that is to just.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Khalil Byrd: </span><span>Who decides that, that it doesn't want to be? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Bram Cohen:</span><span>People in general do want to be co-opted within that movement. It's a bit part of the movement. People don't want their movement sort of adopting.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Sort of petition in general.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.ahbtl0yumzzk"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Khalil</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Byrd: </span><span>My name is Kal Byrd. </span><span class="c11">I'll offer our organization as a case we had a specific goal, and have a specific goal, to put pressure on those harness who own the resources, are controlling the conversation and the opportunity. As we offered a very specific road map, in our case, a new way of nominating a presidential ticket, and soon people who run for office on this state level, and this is a term that I think I just made up here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">We unleashed diffused dissatisfaction amongst groups and saw the network come at us, people who have conversations that had been going on for years about Internet voting, people who were dissatisfied about gerrymandering, people who are angry about special interests and their influence on politics, people who have concerns about transparency. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">These groups as we are moving straight on train tracks toward a specific goal and set of goals, what we found that people sprung up, and they either decided to work within our system or put pressure on our system from outside using all types of different means that you guys are much more sophisticated than I am. So my experience is that, is two things. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">One, for our organization, we do have to lay down a model where we make it understandable as to what we're doing. But we wanted to make sure it was connected as much as possible to to what individuals said was important to them. But we couldn't do anything and can't do anything about those who operate outside of the system, who have better ideas, better thoughts, crisper thoughts or more diffuse thoughts about things that aren't concerns to them so we find ourselves being both leader in one sense but fellow traveler in another.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad: </span><span>Crai</span><span>g, you've you been trying to say something.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Craig</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Newmark: </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.e68bervrvecu"></a><span>Well, thanks to Tim. I observed that the institutions being built on the net tend to be inclusive and actually make things, even if they're abstract. In the spirit of Jeff I'll site the book of why nation's fail, which point out that institutions which are inclusive and build things tend to build cultures and countries which survive at our relatively good places to live. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It's the exclusive extractive institutions which cause countries to go under and so that helps to actually real things. Among the doing real things, address is a brand concern of the nature of astroturfing and the misinformation today that would get me off into a big tangent regarding fact-checking in the press and honest media. But don't get me started. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span>You've written about this role of institutions and the original conditions that created different kinds of economies, highly concentrated ones, more diffused ones and how those common possessions contribute to the development of politics in those different worlds. Can you give us two seconds on the history of that, and then, maybe see if there's a parallel here that you see if you think of the Internet as a space, what kind of original condition is that and what's likely to happen? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.ggac9mm20g8q"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Luigi</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Zingales: </span><span>Sure. It's just I think that the idea of free markets is fantastic in principle. The question is how do you implement in practice. And I think that, all entrepreneurs want a free market when they enter, and that they don't want a free market after they enter. So I think the question is how do you maintain the tension in place? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>An how do maintain a consensus if we enter an open market. And I think that one thing that historically has worked very well is to limit access to funding because if you don't have access to funding it's very difficult to enter. So many, many institutions starting even from usury, were sort of designed to make it difficult for people without money to have access to funds and one thing that actually inspired me is that through the beginning of the sort of Internet revolution. I noticed. Wait a second, in the United States, all of the news starts up as sort of soft made attack and then I look at Italy and you have the existing organization that creates some sort of subsidiary that do sort of Internet and I said, "Why is that the case?" &nbsp;And the answer is because it's very difficult for any start-up to get money. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so it's a very successful way to allocate the rents from innovation to existing companies. If you have a friction in raising funds the only, go to India, many of the new technologies are not developed by start-ups. Now things are slightly changing, but they're developed basically by conglomerates that are owned by one lead guy that has subsidary in cars, another subsidiary in electronics, another subsidiary in Internet, and so on so forth. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Why, again, is access to funding. So, I think that that's one important characteristic. The second is of course the institutions that you create, to make entry more difficult. And I think that one of the fantastic things of the Internet is that at some level, it reduces dramatically many of the frictions that create barrier to entry. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>On the other hand, it does create a gigantic market that is very attractive for anybody to try to enter and close it. So there is this tension between sort of the free entry element and somebody that tries to appropriate the rents. And, if I can add one last thing, and from my point of view in this discussion of leadership, there's one thing that is important in economics when you think about heirarchies this is: who has control. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And we actually talk about the residual right of control. If people disagree who has the right to be pick up and that would mean who is inside the office, who is outside of the office, who has the brand name, who doesn't, and so on, so forth. And I think at some level, the Internet makes it very difficult, precicely in peer organizations because the boundaries are created by everybody, so the boundaries are very sort of soft. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And it's very difficult for somebody to say you are in or you're out. It's more of a voluntary participation that makes the residual rights of control, less important. But also there is an issue I think of allocation of grants, allocation of surplus. And we've seen precisely because of the economics of the Internet where the marginal cost, as was mentioned earlier, is zero. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The winner really tends to take it all. So if you go to that system in place and distribute the rent, there's a huge tendency for somebody to try to appropriate all the rents and then close the door afterward. And that's it whether I need to identify.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Burnham</span><span>: And that's what Tim is worried about. And I do wanna come back and and talk about that, but before we get there, you mentioned you know one thing that I think comes back to the open Internet question and I wonder if I can surprise Beth and ask her to tell, it's not just on the web, there's maybe two markets, there is the market for the economics of the opportunity, but then there's the market for the influence. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And there historically, because prior to the Internet it was very difficult for somebody to have significant influence other than working through some existing industrial hierarchy and you once told me a story about the world's acknowledge expert on the international legal implications of WikiLeaks and I'm wondering if you can quickly tell that story because it illustrates another kind of openness that is a a part of an economy here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.zenkbk77iaf8"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Beth</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Noveck: </span><span>I'll be happy to tell the story, maybe you can draw the connection better than I can. It's the relevance of this particular story, but let me comment on something else. This is Beth Novick, the story that Brad is referring to is that I had a student who just graduated just last year now works for you, of course, Cindy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So she can really tell the story better as to why she hired him. But as a student, what he did, was he wanted to use the network, he used the net and obviously to demonstrate mastering an expertise with a particular topic. He self selected to adopt a specific role to come back to the earlier conversation to say I'm going to start to talk about. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>He wasn't an expert. He just was trying to teach himself something about the legal issues arising from the WikiLeaks case. And he started to tweet about the topic and quickly he developed a following of something like, I don't know, thousands of followers. I don't know what he's up to now, working for EFF, which included 200 leading national journalists. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So, back to the hybrid network an institution argument and Jeff has written nicely about this before but this was the way in which between did meet and he started to get followed by and quoted by the New York Times and the Washington Post and all these very traditional institutions. We started to listen to not only what he said, but the network of followers that he developed on these issues. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And he was able on a personal note to demonstrate his mastery and expertise to an organization like the EFF, who turned around and hired him. And you may have heard him last week interviewed on NPR on On The Media, where he was opining on WikiLeaks and the law, or whatever he was opining, I've forgotten now the topic of the interview. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But maybe you can draw the connection about this story and then I wanna offer a connection.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.d2wpieg9ukp0"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span>The connection is just to not lose sight of the fact that part of the effort to maintain openness and open access, to support innovation that isn't coming from a subsidiary or an existing incumbent but rather coming from an outsider, is not just economic. It's also the market for influence. And here's that story of a kid, who at the time was an undergraduate or graduate, I don't know. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Right. He was a student.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>He was a student.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And he was able to, you know, for arts and minds.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And if you were to go back 30 years and imagine the situation where someone could have achieved that level of influence. The only way you can imagine doing that is having work your way up through a hierarchy and once you work your way up through that hierarchy and paid those dues, the chances that you're gonna represent an outsider's perspective are much less and so there's two elements and the reason for bringing it up in this context is to kind of for the moment keep the conversation around the what's possible with this. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Jess is gonna give me a new work for medium. What's possible for this continent? What's possible for this platform? And to make sure that we're sort of having a little bit of a complete discussion of what's possible before we move on to what the risks are, how to be cooperative, how it can be politicized, how do we need to support it and that sort of thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.xzdu1u1betae"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Beth</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Noveck:</span><span>&nbsp; Let me just offer if I can, since you called on me one additional reflection, sort of to follow on this point and on Tim's comment earlier about networks not replacing hierarchies, is I think what we're seeing, and this gets back to back to Steve's point about the sort of different kinds of ways which networks work is it in this first instance when you're seeing a lot of is this kind of example is information and data coming in from the network back into the institution. So </span><span class="c2">I see this as the kind of first evolutionary phase, is making the center smarter, making institution is smarter, the hierarchy smarter by bringing in a lot of information. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">By crowd sourcing a lot of data, that you can get people by weather watching or tornado forecasting or Greg is bird watching over here, which is a very popular form of citizen science activity that helps make the network smarter. I heard a story yesterday from someone who said that, you know, that government agencies are relying on these kinds of kids, doing water quality testing in their local stream, as a way of essentially not bringing in science that's better than what the professionals can do for themselves but essentially acting as an early warning system to say, "There's a problem over here. We better go check it out." So I think what you are seeing in a lot of first insistence is this kind of aggregated data collection. And then in the second instance which we do not have all the mental models for yet. is this evolution of power question. How do we start moving towards the participatory budgeting, the different kinds of decision sharing and decision making that we're gonna see as in institutions begin to get more comfortable with these kinds of collaborative relationships,</span><span>&nbsp;and I think that's the.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Fred</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Wilson: </span><span>We see the emergence of the participatory budgeting, this is Fred Wilson speaking, in models like Kickstarter and Lending Club and places where the crowd is effectively allocating these resources instead of centralized organizations. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We're invested in a coupler peer-to-peer vending market places instead of some banker sitting inside of some tower in mid town making a decision, you've got literally thousands maybe tens of thousands lenders participating in a marketplace deciding who's gonna get a loan and who's not gonna get a loan, and I honestly think at some point we're gonna see that same model applied to budgeting, fiscal budgeting of of governmental agencies. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I think it makes total sense. You know, I think we all know where we want the money spent in our government, and collectively we could allocate that money and it would guarantee you not go to a lot of places it's going to right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim O’Reilly: </span><span>Yeah</span><span>, city of San Jose has been running participatory budget games and they're actually using that, and it was pretty substantially as input in the city budget.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And is it helpful?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yeah, they say, they claim it is.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.gqodbplg7ht8"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Mike</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Masnick: </span><span>So I think that, sort of building on at least for the last, like six or seven points that were being made, that, you know, </span><span class="c2">this idea that new institutions sort of pop up and replace all the institutions is really important, but there's, in most cases, but not entirely the new ones that are popping up and the new ones that are being accepted, and the ones that we're sort of all talking is sort of wonderful -- the awesome things that we've seen that we like are ones that are more about enabling others do things whereas the older institutions are the ones we fear and the ones we worry about are the ones that acted as gatekeepers and that is kind of a mental model. There was a question of do we set up rules? First of all I do not know if you can set up rules on some of these things. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But the ones that excite us and the ones that seem to enable sort of new economic growth and new wonderful things are the ones that enable someone who nobody knows to somebody who becomes an expert in the subject or enable someone with an idea as to be able to fund it, or to allocate money in different ways, and I think that the fear that we have is that as Luigi said in terms of when they enter the market, they want a free market. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You know, so think of it in the same way. When they enter this world they want to be enablers because that's a path through and it lets them open stuff up. But at some point do they switch and want to become gatekeepers? And so in terms of rules, I don't think we want to set up rules, but I think we want to look at ways to continue to encourage more enabling and less gatekeeping. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And keeping the gatekeepers from shutting down the opportunities do anything? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>I</span><span>&nbsp;think that's the point Tim was making about sort of the architecture of the American revolution and the architecture of governance that was put in place which probably preserved it more than anything else and there's some great stories that could've tipped it either way. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>George Washington was asked to become king, he said "no.", he opened that up. Tiffiniy, you were trying to say something.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tiffiniy</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Cheng: </span><span>Well, yeah, this is a comment on everything that we're talking about, but one thing is that we've been losing on tech policy for 20 years at least. And we finally won SOPA, PIPA.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad: </span><span>What's "we"?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Naomi: </span><span>Yeah. A little ease in there, Tiffiniy. Sorry.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.1roxn0n2ynz8"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tiffiniy: </span><span>Sorry. Well, I mean like that Hollywood has been really, really good at lobbying congress. And </span><span class="c2">throughout history technology has always, the technology that really springs up for a while and gets exciting and is successful, at least for a little while, is the stuff that gives people power and the power that they want, and I think that's really important with the Internet as well. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Internet offers different opportunities for breaking up concentrations of power and it happens wherever there are tools over the platform and that people wanna get involved to it. And where they want the power and I think we can continue to do that. I don't think we're definitely going in that direction, necessarily. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I think there are going to be leaders and people who are putting out campaigns and messages, who, and the tools and the platforms that present these things that people want and will help and where people will grab and help to disrupt those concentrations of power. But, I think what's more interesting about the Internet is that and the SOPA and PIPA fight is that it shows that a publicly regulated space is actually quite exciting for everybody. The SOPA-PIPA fight show that the public can fight for it's own interests, the network can fight for it's own interests, and it can preserve itself in further defined and some meant itself and expand. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And that, you don't need to have, and I do think that the public is gonna rise up, or will try to rise up whenever there are concentrations of power in government or corporations that it sees it can disrupt and work towards this model where the public is really regulating itself, and allowing itself to boost up all the, its own interest and its own powers. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And that's the stuff that creates the vibrant, exciting economy and culture that we all love. But, I guess the main point is that what's exciting about the Internet is showing that the public can be, is very efficient and effective at regulating itself and creating and expanding it's own interest. And I think that it's that interest that we all, you know, when we talk about greater public and social goods. &nbsp;That's the interest I'm talking about. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Cindy's been trying to say something.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.ciuorivhpxe0"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Cindy</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Cohen: </span><span>Yeah, thank you. Cindy Cohn from the EFF. First of all, I am so happy that Beth sent us Trevor Tim and that we now get to give him a job where he's paid continue to do this work.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Thanks for that.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Beth: I have a thousand more unemployed law students.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Well, you know, that leaves that leads me to my next point. Which is, </span><span class="c6">I really like Jaime separating the difference between the steps needed to preserve the open web and then the stuff that does peer-to-peer production on top of it. A lot of the people have talked about the two levels here. And I think that you know I worked mainly on I'm kind of the first level right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">I think what the EFF does is we're the plumbers of freedom. Right? We try to get the obstacles out of the way to build an open network that other people can build really cool stuff on top of, and I just think that keeping that in mind, you know, Yancy's point that the web will win, I think the web will win but I don't think it's automatic.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">I think that there are needs to be careful thinking about what's necessary to protect the fundamentals versus kind of an open space on top to let things build and some of them require thinking about policy and law, which is what I do a lot of. And some of, and of course technology has to be a piece of it as well, but you know, sometimes we focus just on the technology and we don't talk enough about some of the baseline things that have to be in place to let there be an open network, and so I just think I like the distinction between the two levels because I think it talks a little bit more about addressing the, that we get criticized as being techno-utopians a lot of times, and I'm very proud to be a descendant of John Perry Barlow. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">But there does need to be some steps taken in order to protect that openness. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">John Perry </span><span class="c8">Barlow </span><span>Just</span><span>&nbsp;quickly, I wanna look back to something I said earlier about the horizontal versus the vertical. I think it's actually critical that some elements of the vertical remain, and indeed, become stronger. I mean this is apostasy, the some of the people who informed an opinion on my beliefs earlier on, but I am not the hot-eyed Libertarian I was at one point, because I watched the first 10 years of the 21st century. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I think that there is a role for institutions to stop cyclonic accumulations of power and economic force, which the frictionlessness of this kind of economy naturally creates. Nothing has been more conducive to monopoly than the Internet, so far. And it has few natural predators at the moment. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Fred</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Wilson</span><span>: Well, I think the natural predators are the Internet itself. I mean, I think Internet eats its young. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Well, it's true, I mean I remember when every PC in the world was a dedicated Word Perfect server. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim:</span><span>&nbsp;I think he’s talking about predators like Goldman Sachs. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think he's talking about predators like Google and Facebook. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>No, I'm actually talking, it's I understand those things rise and fall, I don't worry quite so much about Google and Facebook as I do about conspiracies of economic interest that can.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Lessig: </span><span>But Goldman Sachs was not created by the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim: </span><span>You need to rely on networks. I mean the whole algorithmic trade-in.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Lessig: </span><span>And to rely on corrupting the regulatory process that was supposed to keep them in place. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So I would blame the corruption more than I would blame the network. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Andy Weissman: </span><span>While Goldman Sachs was not created by the Internet, its brand may be destroyed by the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>That's certainly true.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yes, you again. I'm sorry. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.4q9d0oonpmz7"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jaime</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Boyle: </span><span>Well first of all nothing is more dangerous than saying to a room full of people who probably played Mario Brothers during their formative years mentioning the plumbers of freedom. Which is a very dangerous meme,and you should know that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But picking up on that point. I just want to surface something, I think we can come back to maybe in the third session, but for a long time there has been an assumption and this goes back to the point about that Luigi made earlier. There's been made an assumption that there's a natural ally, a natural alliance between people who want to use the web for various forms of sort of iconoclastic disruption, be it economic or be it social. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And a group of sort of tech entrepreneurs and VCs who understand that the open web is great for innovation and for the future of the innovation and that they all kind of have an interest in preserving the platform. It's sort of Google's got our back to put it, you know, in the crudest forms, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think one of the biggest concerns that we should address in our meeting today is that we have been I think in many ways saved by the idiocy of the lobbying strategy of the MPAA and the RIAA, which up to now has produced the simple "We can ignore you and crush you and just have everything we want." </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>If I were the RIAA or the MPAA, I'd be saying China is a much better model. We can have some elements of a free economy, right? We just don't want other elements, and I think the biggest thing that we ought to think about is driving a splinter, driving a wedge between the people who think, "Oh the web is great for innovation, I can build a new company" and the people who think, "I want the web to be there for personal growth for understanding that I'm not the only lesbian teenager in Boise, Idaho. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>That I can actually form a group with people in my repressive country. That I can sell things to people who I've never met, because I get off on creating, you know, strange mirrored table tops. Those things, those attributes we viewed as chained at the hip. We viewed that to be a natural alliance. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>That alliance is not inevitable at all. Not just because of the point that Luigi made, which is people like to be like to own, they come in liking freedom and immediately want to be a monopolist. A lot of the people who </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>[...]</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>driven the sort of ideology of the venture capitalist class or of the people who have been innovators in this space serial entrepreneurs. They've assumed that the openness of the web is good, because even if their last company may get eaten, they're going to create another one, right? that they like doing that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>That assumption, I think, is really a complacent one, which is we can't assume that that will go on happening and we can assume that people won't be able to isolate it. Well, what would you like? What if we controlled payment systems, right? Payment systems is enough, right? You guys can have your cute, little DNS, whatever that is. and this TCP/IP thing that, I think it's some kind of mouthwash, but anyway you can have that, right? But we just want a controlled payment system, or whatever, right, whatever the next thing so I think that we just need to stop assuming that that alliance will remain always in place. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.5bkkadaowv5e"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Naomi</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Wolf: </span><span>Jay- [sp?], pardon me. </span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>I just have to jump in. so glad that you mentioned China because we're so privileged in the West, and be able to associate innovation and this technology with freedom. But there's a big chunk of the world where people figured out exactly how to use this very same technology and some of these same players in a way that suppresses freedom. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And to your really good point, Beth, about people being empowered to use, you know, citizen science, citizen journalism feed it into the center and make the center smarter, those are people who are being targeted by Chinese authorities when they're documenting who died in the earthquakes, you know, what the school children who were put at risk by shoddy building. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And Ai Weiwei [sp?] who's a well-known dissident, believed what, you know, people in the west believe the Internet creating a space for freedom and then he got detained. So and then you see like these major movers like Google moving into China and because of the points that Cindy was making about the need for legislative and policy support for freedom behaving in a way that central government authorities want them to behave. in relation to freedom. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So, you can have, like, I was thinking of the Mussolini model. You can have a strong corporate state with you know, with burgeoning corporate profits and, you know, key players doing their thing even if they are globalized, in alliance with people who are trying to keep freedoms down. &nbsp;] I think we should always be careful and I know you're saying, don't preempt the downerness of the later sessions, but we should, I think we, right. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>(Brad: we have a whole section on downerness!)</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>No, but I didn't get the is important to look at the beauties and hope that we have here, and keep a sharp focus on it by seeing how easily it's not a given, just as James said.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Mike</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Masnick: </span><span>I think that Jamie's point about the MPAA and RIAA looking at saying China's a good model. First of all, Chris Dodd effectively said that at one point, literally. He said, literally, yeah, you know, Google was able to block stuff in China. That seems like a good way of doing things, and so you should be worried about that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But back to Cindy's point, you know </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.i4iarw52675h"></a><span>part of the reason why all of this happened was that there was this sort of regulatory framework which the openness in terms of safe harbors that allowed a lot of this has happen. And that, you know, I sort of have come around to that where originally I thought there's no need for safe harbors because that seems so obvious to me and you know, most of the same properties around not blaming third parties for what their users do. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I though, well, why would you need that, that seems obvious, of course you don't blame you know, the service provider for the users do. But having that framework in place has made easier for all of these enablers to come about and then to derive from that the fact that the people who use these things identify with them. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.i07rrp5vjkt"></a><p class="c1"><span>And it's not, you know, they don't It's not the same.</span><span>&nbsp;People don't have the same relationship with the Internet as they have with going into the store. right? Because it becomes part of their identity. And so when something like this SOPA PIPA fight comes up, you know, the MPAA looked at it and as sort of an economic fight, whereas everyone else kind of looks at is as this is an attack on my identity. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>I want to come back to come back to that, that whole question of how do people identify with the service providers, and what kind of leverage that gives. And Bram, I know you've been trying to get something in, but I want to go to Wendy, because she hasn't had a chance to say anything. So we'll start with Wendy thanks. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And then we'll get Jaime, who also hasn't said anything today.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Wendy</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Seltzer: </span><span>Great. Wendy Saltzer. I wanted to sort of push back a little bit on Jaime's wild suggestion the alliance between entrepreneurship or entrepreneurial innovation and creative expression fading, or is weak, or is the wrong place to focus. Because I've been looking a lot at user innovation and of the entrepreneurial innovation that's very close to individuals, and there I think there is a lot of shared value with the creative expression because it's the people who are doing something because it has value directly to them and then they also want to share it with the world. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so that sort of leads me in a couple of directions of thinking How can we foster the small scale creativity that stays at the level of individual passion, individual concerns. When it's intention with things like network effect that encourage the growing of larger and larger businesses until eventually Google can't hold to its "don 't be evil, because there are just too many forces pushing it to maximize shareholder value instead of the values of a network." </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.uegvktmdezbi"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad</span><span class="c8">: </span><span>I think we're going to go there, for sure, because what we do want to talk about whether John Perry Barlow’s observation, that you do need some form of vertical. &nbsp; You do need, for a couple of reasons. I think you need it in order to build roads. Peer production is probably not a good way to build roads. But, you also need it to have a very targeted regulation that that allows for the construction of healthy markets. And One of the key things that we're going to have to figure out how to deal with is network effects, and how network effects influence the ability to create healthy markets. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I want to come back and talk about that when we get into sort of the prescriptions a little later in the day, about what we're going to do Jamie, you wanted to get a point in. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.kg4jvxv7keyo"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jayme</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;White: </span><span>Yeah, I guess it kind of comes back to the original discussion of the economics of networks. And in my mind, it seems that people look at the net, they look at the web, and there's a certain the utility they have, they feel towards it, but they express that in different forms of currency. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>When it comes to the stuff that's on top, the services, they will give their data, or they give their cash for, that's their currency. But when it comes to just the net itself, and I think that people view the net as an open space where there's opportunity to share, to collaborate, and to enter new markets. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In that space people will use different currency. And I think we saw that on PIPA SOPA, where they were going to use their political capital and their political energy to protect that environment. So I think it comes back to these two levels. The open net.: people care about that as a political space, and they'll spend political capital. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Then there's the stuff on top and they'll give cash. they'll give their data. And when it came to the MPAA, they were trying to attack the stuff on top. But when people were going to Congress They weren't saying protect my Facebook, they were saying please don't censor the Web. And so I think that's where the NPA [sp?] failed and I think a little understanding, and I think people look at the web in sort of different ways and will spend currency in different ways. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.zbp0205us29v"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Bram</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Cohen:</span><span>&nbsp;Great. And so if I may give a little bit of credence to technological utopianism here since everyone's so down on it. A lot of people talking about the way things used to be is actually the way things for a fairly brief period of time when the world was ruled by broadcast television. There's just this accident of how broadcast television television works. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>That you have this situation where most people are getting most of their information, most of the words they hear over the course of a day, from just a few stations of television which created implicitly this propaganda machine that never been seen before and hopefully will never be seen again. And the Internet by its nature is much more way things were before that, where people communicate fairly directly with each other. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And now China actually has to go through tremendous length to set up this censorship regime that they have and it isn't really all that effective. It appears to be though, that the effectiveness of the great firewall of China is much more as a surveillance technology so they can find out who the leaders are of movements that they don't like and then go take them out with offline mechanisms rather than directly censoring the web. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.ujpo9cpbl460"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Fred</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Wilson:</span><span>&nbsp;I want to just make a point network effects. Network effects work in both directions. So, as more and more people are joining a network the network gets more and more powerful. But it works exactly the same way on the other end. As more and more people are leaving a network collapses very, very quickly. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And we have seen that again and again on the Internet. And I think that this idea that these large institutional networks that have up on the Internet are there forever, is a very bad idea. I think it's completely flawed, and I think that they will undo themselves very, very rapidly by bad acting and we will see it happen, we may be witnessing it right now. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.q6g27j3is5cd"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">John Perry Barlow:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Quick</span><span>&nbsp;thing, they may not Something I think is really worth considering. This is a heterodox view. I recently realized I visited Facebook and Google, with a bunch of U.N. human rights ambassadors, and listen to the spiel. And it dawned on me, that in some weird way they may be the most democratic institutions I've ever seen, because they actually consist of their constituents. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And if you think about how of Facebook has morphed extremely rapidly over the course of its history, and how Google has morphed. I think they feel what their constituents are manifesting and react to it almost in ways that they can't see themselves. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.t16lxcvxd4aa"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Yochai</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Benkler:</span><span>&nbsp;So this is This has been an incredibly rich conversation, and as people have been talking, I've been trying to map it a little bit for myself and just put this on the table to see if it's helpful to others as well along three dimensions. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>One dimension is that of between action.That is to say, the more that the network just allows us to be, the less critical it is to get organized to build institutions to pool people to get leadership, to get focus. The more we're trying to actually achieve a directed outcome, the more certainly but still today we're looking for some kind of direction, some kind of leadership, some kind of focal point. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so the dimension is between action and being, and some of the networks we see in the network is that they allow people to be without also having to be underneath the power of someone else's. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>A second mention is that between structure and particular structure of the flow of power, the flow of being able to shape other people's preferences, behaviors, outcomes individuals and that is the dimension that focuses on, sometimes and this is incredibly important as a tension that was raised in several of the statements between, on one hand, we don't like power the big company power of the state. On the other hand, we understand that sometimes they're necessary to counterpose others. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Right, in a political battle feel it might be important to have allies who are big companies to a network movement because on the other side there's a lot of power sometimes you have if you talk about the necessity of the state in order to create a well-functioning market, it's because you see aggregations of power in certain incumbent corporations that you actually see the state through its regulation as a way of breaking those up. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Sometimes we see companies as a way of breaking up the state, and so these alliances become important. And one of the things networks have actually done is they've allowed us to reach much greater degrees of effective action without actually having to hand over more power to a more powerful structure. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But that doesn't mean it goes that way all the way; its a dimension along which the more structure you have, the more that you lose that individual autonomy. But sometimes you need to give it back and in many senses the American Revolution example that you gave is exactly about trying trying to create somewhere in between these. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The third dimension, is the question of the state versus not the state. It does occupy a unique place in terms of it's ability to tax, raise money, build roads, put people in prison, kill people without getting in trouble, with someone else who could kill it back at least not directly and That creates another dimension that's the question of just how anarchic we can be. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So Larry, when you talk about the Goldman Sachs response its the use of the state in order to capture a certain kind of power within the market in the other direction and so the extent to which we see think we're going to be anarchic, and just build something on the side, be it, in up through the mid '90's, the free market we'll take care of the goal that's privatized versus society and we can build it by ourselves and that means disaster management with ushahidi -- the State remains an incredibly powerful actor and is another dimension. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>A particular solution space and particular problem space and most of the things people have said fall somewhere useful in this three dimensional space. The tensions between whether its about action more or being more and the question about whether or not its about harnessing or stopping the state versus to something that can be done fully in the non-state. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And the question of how much individual economy we can retain without losing efficacy to a degree. And that to me, a lot of the statements are organized in that way, usefully. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad: </span><span>Steven and then Luigi. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><h2 class="c1"><a name="h.49nqdcmw4mss"></a><span>What do we call this thing?</span></h2><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.baewwy4epuaq"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Steven</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Johnson: </span><span>Yeah, I mean, that's perfect. if I just could build on Johan's[sp?] ideas which is one of my favorite things to do. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So what I was thinking was, </span><span class="c7">I was thinking about of words and kind of ideal types in this. So think about the power of words like bureaucracy, monopoly, and free market, all right? We just cite them we don't have to explain what they are and you can disagree about whether this thing is a monopoly or whether this thing is a free market or whether this thing is a bureaucracy but we all kind of agreed roughly that there's a certain Architecture that these things have are either good or bad generally, we have a cultural consensus about that, we don't have to explain what a bureaucracy is time we invoked it right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">And so my question is, to the group and its an open question, I have an opinion on it but I wonder what the group thinks. Is there another world that is some kind of ideal type, peer production, peer networks, you know, might be one way of describing it. That's out there that is a point on that kind of cubic continuum there that you just outlined with the three vectors, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">So bureaucracy is here on those three vectors. Free market is here. Is there a reliable useful other point that we could call a peer production, or peer network -- network network is slightly different and there's some cases that are a little bit different and one after the other but they are close enough that its useful to have this category so that we all kind of have The word that we point to and we can say, Yeah, that's great. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Facebook is built a peer network. But the internal organization of Facebook is not a pure network and that's a flaw. so they have something we can point to that we rally around that we really believe in that's a useful set of terms, and we can debate what those terms are but are we in agreement that there is that rough ideal type out there or do we think that that's trying to close it down too much? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.djjivs6pu8ye"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Brad: </span><span class="c7">So if we can stay with Stephens point, and just try and flesh that out. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.9m6tf11wzwfk"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Tim</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;O’Reilly:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;I'm so struck when Yochai was talking about a book I just recently read a manuscript which is Bill Janeway’s “doing capitalism”. And he actually distinguishes also a three part structure. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">I'm wondering if it isn't actually a four part structure. He also points out the follow the state. But what I find most interesting in his book is he distinguishes between markets as we normally understand them. which are basically people exchanging goods and services among each other, and financial capital which is his third great actor and The distinction that the market and financial capital are not the same seems to me to be very powerful. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">And one of the questions that I have here is new thing that we are looking at more like financial capital or more like the market in real goods and services and I think it's more like financial capital.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">(Brad: In what sense?)</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">In the sense that maybe this is in the sense that George Soros talks about financial capital is Its really a notion more than anything else, you know he talks about the power of. Things that are true only if people believe in them opposed to absolutely true or false and I wondered this some of the reputation economies that we're talking about have that same kind of intangibility of shared belief that money does and and I'm wondering if that's a productive dimension to think about all that under, in some sense you know when you exchange real goods and services there are constraints that you don't have when you're exchanging intangibles and that there's something about the power of and the scale of networks in ideas, whether they're ideas of money or ideas of reputation or attention or any of these other things that we're kind of talking about in this economy that may be worth just thinking about. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Brad: </span><span class="c7">Let's do [xx] and then Larry and hopefully we can get back to Steve at some point. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.5wgc80nibf8d"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Yancey</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Stricker: </span><span>But this is to Steven's idea and to Tim's idea. </span><span class="c7">I don't have a word for it, but I think that we're talking about our networks of us. And us and its a very fluid thing, us changes for everybody, us is about politics. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">it's about identity, it's about personal experiences, and we're constantly I think changing what we identify with and what that "us" means. But I think that's kind of what that space is and who we feel we belong to and what we feel belong to is a lot of what determines the directions that we go in and its the reason why this stuff is so hard to pin down because there's nothing to pin down because it's a broader affinity in that opportunity actually take some action on it.. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Steven Johnson: </span><span class="c7">That’s why I’ve always loved the word peer. I mean, partially the way they used it, because it had that same meaning of your peers, the wisdom of your peers, a jury of your peers. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Brad: </span><span class="c7">It's also related to what Mike was saying earlier People felt committed to defend the services that they felt that they've invested in, that they cared about In a way that they wouldn't if they felt that they were in a customer supplier relationship so its a different relationship, I think that's part of what Stephen is trying to get to.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Lessig</span><span class="c5">:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;So I want to respond directly to Steven's question. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">I'm not happy with this word. I'm not happy that it's being used in this way. But I was struck when I was doing research for this little ebook that I just put out, that people invoke the term “open source” across context in a way that sounds like it's talking about the same thing. So Mark Meckler and his book about the tea party says it was an open source movement. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">I interviewed people from Israel who were talking about the 400,000 march. That was an open source movement. The Occupy people think of what they were doing as an open source movement. When you push them about what do you mean by that, they all talk about the same sort of thing. not a single person who is going to direct it, there's not a concentration of power, it's reflecting the sort of judgements that spread across and that begins to feel like, you know, again I'm not sure if its the right word, but it begins to feel like the sort of things that stands next to bureaucracy or free market as an alternative. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">MIke Masnick:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;Can you, because I agree that maybe it's not right that you drop the source part and it’s just “open”</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Open source is a more, has more specific meaning because you feel like. Maybe not anymore, though. No, that's the point, right. I guess I communicated it a little bit. Yeah, you have. Actually it's been a </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.r25sl0kmwr1u"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Mark</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Surman: </span><span class="c7">I guess the question is can a modifier standing in for and now like bureaucracy and I think one of the questions I would ask to that and it fits a little bit with something Yancy said, is can we make the Internet or the web be those words, right I mean bureaucracy or financial paths I mean they are just words we can make them whatever we want, especially on a longer arc. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">But I do think that modifier of open has really started to go across everything. But the thing that made me think that in response to your question is I was just rereading the piece that Joi Ito put in the Times when he first got to MIT. It opens with a great line, which is "The Internet is a belief system" A philosophy of bottom-up innovation and, you know, distributed something something something that opening phrase, "The Internet is a belief system". </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">if you go back and you think about science, I met with the Royal Society six weeks ago. And what was astounding to me is here is a 352 year old institution that still believes in the ideological project it was founded for. &nbsp; Right and its still incredibly idealistic and to think we could take the word web or the word Internet ever open what we're talking about here and, you know, 352 years later be able to say that's something that became that common parlance and we can still recognize it -- I actually think that's not impossible to imagine achieving and we may have the word in front of us, I mean, we may be slicing hairs because we're concerned about the technical meaning of these words think we can pick any of these words - </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Bram</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Cohen: </span><span class="c7">but what does the word mean, to Clay's earlier point, open source projects are - I think that's what Nancy said actually, sorry that's the other thing. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Alright open source projects are frequently extremely centralized, you have these literal cabals of I don't like that people, that nobody knows who they are unless they are really into it.

In fact I think that every attempt we make to define the Internet by necessity limiting. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And that what we're talking about here, what we're really talking about here is principles, beliefs of our society, aspirational beliefs of our society the Internet is just a tool to that end. And so to define and act as if the Internet is a thing, an institution, or whatever necessarily the limits, and if you believe that we're only, that, that the change we think we're undergoing right now we think is very fast, I argue is actually very slow and we're at the very beginning. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>and there was a Rand study in the nineties that said that those societies that tried to limit the press and limit what it did were left behind of others So I think what we are really asking here is principles well what are those principles what do they mean -- what does “open” mean -- well I think we have to learn from Wall Street that the hash tag was a platform for discernment. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>From my very brief time as a congregationalist, before I was kicked out of yet another church you know, I learned that they don't have a creed.

So if you look at something like Wikipedia, it is collaboration without cooperation to a first approximation the most participants and the most articles don't talk to any other participants on that article. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And then there's a small white core of Wikipedians Make the whole thing work A matter of fact,most of the participant ain't a member of a community in a terrible meaningful way, They are part of a us</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>They are a part of a us, yes, no thats the idea of us and what so, I guess, so let me say that of a community and make a point in here. We all towards democracy is a natural one for Americans especially to reach for. But democracy, democratic systems tend to be systems in which the cost of identity is low and the cost of group communication is high. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And we're we're in an inverse situation, so in most places I can't think in fact of anything I think of as being Internet native that relies voting, but I can think of places that rely on [group editing], that rely on karma, or that rely on [forking]. And those seem to me to be three kinds good decision making a little bit like peer review being enabled by the printing press. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>By voting, you mean representative. Yes, sir, representative voting, one, we have the franchise one vote per person. Yes, I'm sorry. So, yeah, to your point, classic democratic franchise. Representative democratic. Representative It's not bad.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>Reddit is.

It's a duocracy in the... in a way that Dave Clark famously identified [xx] in running code, that the up votes and down votes, the work is being done by the people who are showing up. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>so there isn't idea of the franchise as much. There are certainly limits on who can participate. But it seems to me that the characteristic that runs across a lot of stuff you regard as being Internet native is you can't be alienated from your own contributions. Whatever else happens after you've contributed, you can't be alienated I can fork this. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I can fork Wikipedia if I wanted and, you know, remarkably. And impractically in a way and yet conceptually they're still really committed about inalienability is a crappy word, Steven, to put in your sort of idealized type. But that strikes me as being part of what we love about it. these are elements, certainly. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.s5jo7wp1uq5p"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Larry</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Lessig: </span><span class="c7">But you're asking more for an empirical point about what is a meme, what is the meme if you could capture Here's the point. Here's the point. It seems to me that there is this underlying archetype, and then there's a meme. But what's interesting about the evolution of memes is that you always have this history of people it's not what other people give you, then I think it is.So, if it's source happens, and we have Richard Stallman screaming [xx]. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">If now people like Meckler say he's starting an open source movement and the software people say, "No, no, no, no. This is not open source. There's no Linus Torvalds in the middle of this movement." And so the point is in some sense, we don't have ability. It are just our words, but we don't have the ability to control the way this is going to evolve. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">It's going to evolve in a certain way, and so what you are asking is what's the thing that seems to be evolving a conceptual space, which stands against this idea, or stands in one of Yochai's three or twelve.

We are 12 dimensions of different organizations.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.50lq6miscge"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c5">John</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Perry Barlow: </span><span class="c7">I think it may be better to leave it as an unnamed thing that we know when we see.

It would be nice if we had that perfect description which is what you're asking for and I think part of the problem here is we remember that, you know, </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.erb970p8bufc"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span>one of the things that I learned from the fight for a future folks is the importance of naming, I think you guys came up with the net which was a much more or you didn't come up with it or when you popularized it or whatever, I mean We [xx] Internet [xx] It was a group. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Hollywood, [because] it was so important. It was a group [it was a group] But there was an emergence of something that had a more powerful resonance than, you know know intermediary liability. So, there is a value in this name. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But Mike, you've been trying to get something in. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.m91a7k56w2np"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Michael</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Manness: </span><span>Hi, I'm Michael Manis.. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>One of the things that strikes me out all these conversations. Is there something around an organized asymmetry to this? What I mean by that is, it's not a financial system where you basically you need to get something equally back. Nor is it a system where the things we were talking about where there's this possibility where a little bit of contribution could amass more and also reflected back, the reflection back that you get for being part of their organization. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But I also see it in the rise of, I'm with the Knight Foundation, in the rise of people applying around things around disaster relief and water, which have little to do with news, you know in the traditional sense but everything to do with post institutional thinking; where these are kind of key quality things what happens a disaster, what happens after water, how do you manage water, which we used to have institutions to do, private or for-profit, whatever you wanna think non profit government and there's a huge exhaustion around the ways those are being effective or not being effective and so I think there is something around us because those systems are built to eb and flo and also expand rapidly. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think an asymmetrical organization if you have those kinds of things, but then, and that seems to be a little bit of what everyone's kind of grasping at because we dont we havent seen it before what do you mean by an an asymmetrical think its something that i mean its more of getting around the network notion where you might have the rules in place, but no one's there yet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But then when something, when a need arises That community can build itself or an organization can build itself. That it might drift down again or it might rise up, but that's something that we haven't seen I don't think before. Or at least built, where you have to become rational actors of classic economics, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Like you have to pull to the notion of horizontal versus vertical. You have to start pulling capital resources. I would say something like Occupy Wall Street. It's asymmetrical, it's all we have, we can't find somebody here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.ttzm0wld6z91"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span>There's a sense that if it has more of an impact than you would expect, because it doesn't, it can achieve more more with less inputs than in his...</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Michael Maness: </span><span>Yeah, I mean, Ethan Zuckerman's work around what happened with Occupy is the first thing happen semantically, that the term Occupy shifted from being associated with Palestine to be associated with Wall Street. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So that's the first shift, right? But then the other rise of Occupy is Occupy as a word, Occupy Washington as a word doesn't get very far, it doesn't rise in the link that Occupy Wall Street. Those terms don't grow that much and regular ceramic cues. what explodes in regular semantic use is 99%. Right. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Right? So the impact of Occupy Wall Street is not necessarily the have it, the act of it itself but the language that got about fit in and spread out percent impact of presidential race or not. Certainly if I were to say 99% a year ago, that would have meant nothing to you. and I can say that now in the way that we're talking about these words, where all of a sudden that means all kinds of things. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so that I think is an interesting rhetorical [xx], that is an organization just by participating in the visual elements of that and other aspects of it, you actually can engage in a way that changes the course of presidential events never happened before. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.rntcqj447iyj"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Jamie</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Boyle:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;I think one reason - this conversation is very stimulating - but I think one of the reasons why we're stumbling around looking for words is we're actually engaged in sort of three or four different tasks, all of which are very valuable but which are different. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">And so the word which would satisfy one of them will not satisfy the criteria. We once said that definitions are insurance policies against confusion and no insurance policy insures against all risks, right? So what are we doing? One of the things we're trying to do is understand why stuff works, stuff that we're familiar with. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Like why does this peer-to-peer thing work? That's kind of a thing about, one of the things Yochai is doing in the wealth of networks is like, 'How does this stuff work, because it's counterintuitive.' So that's an understanding task. A second goal is - and this is something Steven was talking about - what are our bedrock principles? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Surprise, fear, and a ruthless dedication to the network, right? You know, it's like, what are the things that you must sign on to if you're with us does leadership fit in there or not, is that an optional one? That's a completely different task. Like normative. It's like what are we for? Right. and the third is sort of popularized. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">there was a tagline, a way of explaining this with the elevator pitch. Different again from the first two. and there's a fourth which is sort of trembling out there that is the process of naming something that actually creates it. So the environment. The environment doesn't actually exist before 1950. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Yes, there were lakes, there were their size, right? But the idea that someone who cares about escape of genetically modified salmon and that someone who cares about smog, that those things are linked, or that the way trash is linked to the fact that I can't see across the street in Beijing.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">That's a creation, and the word environmentalism takes a whole lot of people with very different interests. I like to shoot birds. He likes to look at birds. We should both care about environmentalism, right? seen kind of opposed if environmentalism says we're under the same tent. That's not just understanding, it's not just what for it's not even just explaining something to someone in an elevator or a phone booth. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">of naming that creates the reality it purports to describe and I actually think those four conversations are all going on here.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.h8ylis91osg9"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Steven</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Johnson: </span><span>Why are the first two different if I assuming explains how these amazing things work, and those become the values we want to see more of. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.ksvo44rxochm"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jamie Boyle: </span><span>I mean, they're a set of ingredients and so it's like our values are we want to see more of those ingredients I mean, briefly, because I think there are lots of modes of organization that work on the Net that we're not necessarily in favor of. </span></p><h2 class="c1"><a name="h.g6yhlxrmb3sl"></a><span>Economics of networks</span></h2><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.jtou9ra0km3f"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Fred</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Wilson: </span><span>Brett, </span><span class="c10">I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;want to talking about the economics of networks and one of the things I have observed over the years and I don't know if it's correct or not but I want to throw out just to discuss a little bit regarding economics is that the sustainable networks on the Internet are networks that don't try to maximize their economics. And that they actually try to minimize their economics. And that sustainable potentially are at odds with the entire notion of capitalism which is about maximizing economics. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I'm curious if people have observed that and whether that's a crock of whatever or actually something to think about. </span><span>of Craig's [xx].

But has some economics in it, right? that's the interesting thing about it. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because we were talking about Wikipedia before and I think Clay said that Wikipedia has struggled to sustain itself. and that it's economics are so thin that may not be sustainable whereas that in Craigslist, I mean I am not familiar with the economics, but it appears to be sustainable economically but not maximized economically. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.1n8coshlldsm"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Craig Newmark: </span><span class="c0">I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;take issue with your use of the term capitalism.

That's JB. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jamie Boyle: </span><span>It 's entirely proprietary. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yeah. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And stolen. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>And so is there, to get back to, you know, maybe we can spend, you know, five or ten minutes as we wrap this up, you know, thinking about is there, can all of this be wrapped up in the notion of an environmental movement for the Net and is that a phrasing that can have legs or does Steven need more than that? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.4qiyw7oz12z2"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Steven</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Johnson: </span><span>no, well, I am so glad you brought it back to that metaphor from [xx] because the point I was gonna make actually is that talking about value and Fred's kind of measurements, I mean, think about the success of the idea of kind of true cost accounting in the environmental movement, that we actually measure the external cost of all of these things and polluters and things like that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And just that concept is so valuable, so it sounds like a hardware store, but the idea that we would have True Value coming here as well you're actually able to kind of say, well just additional stuff in addition to the profits. In this new book, I talk about this idea also from ecosystems which is, you know, ecosystems have this idea of primary productivity, which is how much a given unit of energy is kind of distributed throughout the entire ecosystem. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Green [xx] a really good have a lot of energy and productivity, right? So one of the things that the web has done is increased radically the information productivity over the last twenty years, so that every unit of information is actually circulated much more widely through system, and that's one of those things that actually creates all this additional value that is not necessarily captured monetarily or in profits but is a huge benefit so having those metrics as a way of kind of measuring the success of these institutions would be really valuable. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.y74iu9pgluc7"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Yancey</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Strickler: </span><span>Yeah, kind of a similar idea. There was a great piece of congressional testimony it was in '03 or '04 in front of some subcommittee. And someone gave a talk about the immorality in GDP. And we use GDP as a measurement of growth of our society, but of course there are no value judgments inside GDP. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>According to a measure on GDP, the perfect citizen is someone who has terminal cancer, is going through a divorce drives an SUV and eats out every night, and these are things that as a society we say we do not value but this is implicit in what we value as a culture or as an economy. The thing about maximization, and Kickstarter certainly is a company that is very steadfast in not seeking maximize and people sometimes view that as being altruistic or naive or something like that, but I think it actually just reflects an inability to measure these other pieces There is trust. There is brand. There is an understanding of an audience and a community that can be demonstrated in that way. And simply by taking a slightly different viewpoint of what the goal of a business is or an network. It can really shift what the priorities are and what it is that is produced. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.n7scitpufy3x"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Khalil</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Byrd: </span><span class="c7">My comment goes back to the naming of the environmental I've been a political person who's involved in message conversations my whole career. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">They're difficult. And it's difficult to find those right words. It was when Teddy Roosevelt went out west on one of his hunting trips and noticed there were fewer buffaloes that conservationism was creating, and he created a society in New York, and I guess I would ask the technologists here was in the early part of the twentieth century. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">I would ask this group here, is SOPA that equivalent of going out West and finding there are fewer buffaloes. What is moment where you actually know that you have something to name, much less the process of naming something. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.pa0mlxno2snk"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Mark</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Surman: </span><span class="c7">Or is Facebook But I guess as opposed to SOPA, the Buffalo, but I think to answer your question I would say yes. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">The environmental movement, the web, is certainly something I've thought about a lot and the thing to go back even further than Teddy Roosevelt and to kind of [xx] is really the environmental movement is sort of similar to what was saying, a whole bunch of people coming to the same responses to industrialization at the same time and to the kind of [xx] resource. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">So whether it's [xx] Powell getting kids to camp or whether it's Sierra Club bringing people to hike or whether it's Roosevelt or the conservation movement and they're going back to hunters, all these things happen at once, and I think kind of a moment that we're in in relationship to the web, what's important in that is, you know, it does take that seventy years before, you know, what we think of as the modern environmental movement names itself. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But also in that whole 70 years and certainly even more since the fifties, there's an incredible ability to diversity around a set of values that we can imagine ourselves inside of. And you know that then creates a lot of conflict as well Well, is this green or is this not green or are we green washing? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So, this is talk something like Greenpeace in the same way. And you need both in fact, you need the Boy Scouts and you need Greenpeace. But the other thing I would say in addition to that diversity is the environmental movement, unlike almost any other modern social movement, are certainly more so, and very much like the web, started with people's joy and appreciation of that thing, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So, that connection to nature, that desire to protect something, all of that, really, the Sierra Club is a recreational club, right? It's a club of hikers and it's only really 70, 80, 90 years on where we start to think of it as an advocacy organization. Or early on, you know, it was advocacy for parks. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so I think that's the other thing peel that off. Those were the early conservationists. And they're not in this room and they're also not the people who are out in the street protesting against SOPA. and I think that group of people, giving them some consciousness, why it feels like ah I'd like to pick up on </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Mark</span><span>'s comment about the joy of creation because no one so far has mentioned the excess there are still people who do not have broadband access. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Finland has made it a constitutional right to have broadband access. we don't have 4G everywhere.

I want to give you heart. I want to give you a reason to be hopeful, though, because Steve and I realized a few years ago that the only part of Reddit that was not open source was Reddit itself. So we open sourced the site, and it ruined us. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I'm just kidding, it didn't. The traffic skyrocketed. I don't think that was causal, but it was clear that the value of Reddit was entirely in the community, entirely in the network. I've actually been trying to bug David into open sourcing Tumblr, we'll see how that goes. But I am so impressed by all of the value that is created by this community, and I see this time and time again online, and I wish we could quantify I wish we could get some grasp on it, but we've gone out of our way to not try to crush it, to not try to stifle it and not try to ruin it through terrible advertising, through treating our users like garbage, and it's been more of a struggle. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We are profitable now, but not nearly as we could be, given all those billions of page views, but I believe that in the long run, I know Brad is written about this. These communities are to be best monetized the way you would, you know, monetize a city like New York. And that is create a great environment for people to do awesome stuff and make them want to be there and have that transaction somehow flow back in the form of taxation, but with a sexier name.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.xy9csnszz560"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Craig</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Newmark:</span><span>&nbsp; you guys got more clout than I knew because as we just were speaking this, Gaurdian UK just published a story For a, this says Gaurdian's open 20 Fighter's for Internet and 5 of the 20 are people I could almost smell from here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I just want to say that I am Craig Newmark and you both completely misunderstood my [xx]. With that There's a bunch of people who are listening on the audio stream. We can see that because the Twitter stream It's showing that and we should give them a sense of when we we're going to pick back up because they may be interested in joining us again. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We'd love to have them join us again And lunch is schedule for 45 minutes, so we should be back here at 1:15. 1:15 so everybody who is out there on the audio screens Due back in at 1:15 </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c1"><a name="h.4wiri8pxshpv"></a><span>Session 2</span></h1><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>So, I had a bunch of conversations at lunch about the importance of focusing on some concrete policy initiatives and some tactical approaches to realizing those policy initiatives, and so what I think we would like to do is you know, we've sort of reserved that for the third part of the day, and what I think we'd like to do is to bring that forward a little bit, and so it will bring that sort of it's in the middle of this second part of the day, and I think it will, probably based on the conversations I had take us through the end of the day. But the way I wanted to start this afternoon is a little bit you know, as a way of following up what happened this morning, by asking a couple of people who are running institutions, organizations, networks, entities that have some of the characteristics that we were trying to define. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Just talk really briefly about a couple of the choices that they made in defining their organizations, and that's going to just bring us back to the morning conversation, summarize a couple of things, and then we'll move beyond that quickly to talk about what I can't remember who used the term threat index first, but it's the threats. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And in order to do that piece, I think what I'd like to do is ask Cindy, give her a few minutes to think about what that is, and to talk about it from her perspective. You'll have a few minutes there work on that, and then I'd like to ask Larry to talk a little bit about his experience of the way the current political system supports these threats, and perpetuates these threats, and that will lead us into the conversation about what we can actually do about it. So to come back to the summary of this morning and the thinking about this new form of organization. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Just as we broke for lunch, I was in a conversation over here trying to define this new kind of entity. It isn't a...you know, we were talking about it just before we broke. This notion the entity could be a structure of the corporation could be a network that is completely empowered its’ users recognize the value in the users, serve the users in a way but do it. sustainably, with a set of economics that supports that network, so it has that characteristic that looks a little bit like a business, but be driven by a set of values that are at least more comprehensive and complex than maximizing profit, and so we have a couple of people built organizations like that and maybe I could ask each of them to talk just for a second about why they made the choices that they made. Yancy, can I start with you? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Yancy Strickler:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>Sure, so I guess one of the fundamental inspirations behind Kickstarter is that for the past hundred years the kinds of ideas that have managed to flourish in our society and really to find funding have been ones that have the capacity to generate money. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You know the primary way things have been funded for the past 100 years have been through investment that you’re looking for things that are a good bet to produce revenue and produce a return that's a very limited scope of ideas. Its .001%, and many ideas have no notions of generating any money at all. They're just something that someone wants to see exist in the world and they want the satisfaction of that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We've had a financial system that didn't account for that and instead people were left with either debt, rich parents or grant applications, maybe something along those lines. so what I think is most disruptive about Kickstarter isn't the participation of the crowd, it's obviously each part of it the fundamental question behind funding from “Will this produce revenue?” to simply “Do I want this to exist?” And that creates a significantly lower bar that allows a lot more things to have to opportunity to come to life. So I see that as being real important. The other thing I would add, just for our sake , is that the projects that are going through Kickstarter have a very long, creative life, and the funding, in just one moment of them, mails are distributed, and they're produced and all these other kind of things. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We think it is really important as a business to focus on something that is just very specific. We don't want to be monolithic, we don't want to try to do everything because we wouldn't know how to. Instead we're trying to precisely define one mission and one thing that we think we can do and ignoring the rest and allowing for an ecosystem to develop to take that place and that's a choice made because is it sustainable because it seems more fun, because it is what we are interested in. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>But it also defines your brand, the things that you choose not to do. I mean, you've chosen not to do crowd funding of for-profit start-ups. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Yancy Strickler: </span><span>Right. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>You've chosen not to do things that are like funding an organization or something. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Yancy Strickler: </span><span>Yeah. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>You're funding projects, and so by choosing, by defining what you don't do, you define more clearly what the brand stands for, why people should bring their projects to Kickstarter, and why funders should come to Kickstarter and what they should expect to find there. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Yancy Strickler: </span><span>Yeah, I mean, saying no is really important. Saying no is almost always been the right decision for us. We don't allow advertising when Kickstarter. We don't allow brand sponsored projects. When a major brand reaches out saying we want to put a bunch of money in a bunch of things. We say you can sign for an account like anybody else, and you can back a project. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And, you know, so I'd get an email saying Coca-Cola pledged twenty bucks to your project if Coke wants to do that. But obviously that is not why they wanna do that they wanna do that for their own leverage. So we like the idea of a space that is </span><span class="c22">us</span><span>, you know I've that word us before but it's just all us, it's just Everyone is the audience, and so I think that there's something really powerful about that, and it brings with it a trust and maybe an understanding that we are steering where this goes, and so everything that happens is self-determined by everybody. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>You do have a very interesting notion in that but I think it is, I’ve heard, or seen in a number of other peer networks, and that is, every one in the network's a peer, including the most powerful corporations. They can come into the network. There's nothing to prevents them from being in the network, but they have no better access to resources or or supporters than anybody else. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Tumblr has taken the same approach. They've invited corporations to participate in Tumblr, but they have to create a Tumblog and it's the same sort of thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Fred</span><span class="c8">:</span><span>&nbsp;Twitter did the same thing, largely accidentally. Because, you know, when they got started, they had no notion of fan page or a corporate page or anything like that, and so companies that want to engage in Twitter had to open a Twitter account almost like anybody else. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But unlike Kickstarter, they have made some concessions, if you will. The possibility to verified account sessions and the ability to have, they created some power let to 10 people tweet under the @coke handle. And those may or may not be healthy actually. But, you know, that idea that everybody is a peer in the system probably is something that's fundamental to what a peer network is. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Steven Johnson</span><span>:</span><span>&nbsp;Also, note that we are back to the leader-founder thing because you're not peers in the sense of...some of those peers probably wanted to fund their start-up. And the founders set the scope of the project and limited that is there is the interesting command structure that inside of this beautiful and I think its a wonderful thing that you guys did but that whatever you're doing to limit the range of it is one example of center being a little bit stronger. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jeff Jarvis</span><span class="c8">:</span><span>&nbsp;Have you changed anything because...did you same yes to anything? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Yancy Strickler</span><span>: No. Yeah, I mean, you know, we take a very broad, you know, we determined our mission to be supporting creative projects, furthering the creative works. Those are very nebulous phrases, obviously, and can be defined a lot of ways. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We try to take the broadest definition as we can that does fit with...there is a set of values that begin so we like things that are done due to creative expression or some sort of personal fulfillment I think are always great motivators, whereas maximization or commercial interest I think are less so. So, definitely there's an implicit ideology and how we structured it. And certainly we are an idealistic group of people, and I think that in some ways that comes through. But in the end, you know, we created a space and we're inviting people come in and use it, but we don't want to have much more to say beyond that than just what are the basic.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>That notion of </span><span>creating a space and creating...sort of the laws of physics within that space, which then creates a set of outcomes that you don't control but that is a kind of founding principle and gives you that...Let's move to Alexis. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim O’Reilly:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>Can I make a quick comment real quickly on one of the things you're saying? One of the things that it seems to me that you've done at Kickstarter is that you've made the rules explicit and so therefore, the decision making is no longer sort of hidden inside the organization. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The decision making is basically public beforehand and you know, the decisions you're making are perhaps you'll tune the architecture a little bit. But then you publish it. Versus, say, a business that is making it's you know, product plans in secret, say, a la Apple. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>So, we're adding principles here. There's this principle of everyone's a peer. And we just added the principle of transparency that does seem to be a characteristic that is healthier peer networks. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c14">Clay Shirky:</span><span class="c8 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">There's also, Kickstarter does an amazing job of providing information to the users of the system, who are the front end, the sort of dashboard. A student of mine, Fred Benenson, is one of the early employers, and now spends a lot of his time just with R literally trying to understand what are the internal dynamics. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">But instead of saying, once we know the internal dynamics we can game our user base. They say, once we understand the internal dynamics we can educate our user base. Etsy does this around teams as well. You're in the business of making your own customers smarter, contrast a bank or an airline. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c14">Brad Burnham: </span><span class="c14">Or a wireless carrier. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c14">Clay Shirky: </span><span class="c14">Or a wireless carrier, right. All of the confusopoly businesses are in the opposite business of the business Kickstarter is in. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c14">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8 c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14">So there’s empowerment versus control principle as well. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Bram Cohen:</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">Did you ever think of Kickstarter as a hack around the very stringent regulations around micro investment?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Yancy Strickler: </span><span class="c7">No. The investment part was certainly something that we talked about before, but was never the goal. Because I think that investment is a different lens to look at things from. It's more mercenary. And we liked the more of the collectivist spirit of "let's make things." And so, you know, the jobs act and things like that, we have nothing to do with that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad </span><span class="c8 c0">Burnham</span><span class="c8 c0">: </span><span class="c0">Alexis, </span><span class="c0">I'm particularly interested in the decision that Reddit made to open source.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Alexis Ohanian: </span><span class="c0">Well, it was something that had been on our minds for a little while. And actually credit to Steve Newhouse. This happened post-acquisition. They actually brought it up during one of our quarterly meetings and said, "Weren’t you guys going to open-source the site?" Steve and I looked at each other... “Yeah, you should definitely do that.” And we got some documentation together</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The repercussions of that were that we end up hiring some fabulous developers from that -- white hats -- who discovered security exploits and let us know and also used that open source to build interesting things. It really demonstrated that the value was in the community. And when Steve and I were sitting in that little apartment in Medford...also, looking at each other -- &nbsp;</span><span class="c22 c0">never</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;set your computers on opposite sides of each other, because then you’re just staring at your cofounder all day long playing Warcraft...we realized that one, all Redditors were equal and no Redditors were more equal than others. And this is partially because I love George Orwell but also because we had a karma system that encouraged people to contribute, but at no point did we want a power-user to exist with hundred of thousands of karma points, to have more than a vote. A new user should be able to come to Reddit and get on the front page that same day, and then be on the Today Show the next day. Which is literally what happens now. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is in stark contrast to our chief competitor, Digg, which I think in many instances, although they were there first, with the celebrity founder who launched it on a TV show months before we did, months before we were aware thankfully because by being ignorant of our competition we built a site the way we thought it should be built, which is one where it is totally equitable and where we did as much as could for our users. That's why there's so little advertising on Reddit. That's why we wanted, maybe to a fault, such information density on the front page and we decided to let people create their own sub-Reddits. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We did that just because we didn’t have a clue what to make. We made first the sub-Reddit programming because a bunch of programmers said that programming linksweren’t showing up &nbsp;on the front page anymore. And at that point, we realized </span><span class="c22 c0">we have no idea what to do with this</span><span class="c0">. We will build a tool to let anyone who wants to create a sub-Reddit, and if they want to create one called IAmA...three years later Woody Harrelson is doing a catastrophic interview there and then a week later Neil DeGrasse Tyson is doing a fabulous interview. That all happens because a bunch of people, most of whom I have never met are so invested in this tool and are as excited for the success of their subreddit as Steve and I were when we were seeing that heart and watching that little traffic graph go up. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that does wonders. It doesn't take much. It's really showing a few graphs. And making someone feel some ownership over something. But it's enough to get people to do brilliant, wonderful things.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Again I'm hearing this notion of bringing information back into the system, sharing with users and empowering users with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Mike Masnick: </span><span class="c0">I was just gonna ask with the open sourcing of Reddit which, I think you're, right when you kinda highlighted the community and then it wasn't the software that was the issue, it was the community that was built around the software, but the question is what's been done with the...is there anyone who has actually done anything that as sort of long lasting as the open source.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Alexis Ohanian:</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Well, it will probably not surprise you that I think, to date, the most trafficked open source version is entirely for pornography. Unfortunately, no, there hasn't been...no one has created...you know, we always kind of wondered, you know, it's probably only a matter that time before a bunch of Redditors get really angry and go off and launch their own Reddit, but hasn't happened yet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, part of that is also due to the fact that there hasn't been...I mean, Reddit now has ten employees...we’re catching up Craigslist...but there hasn’t been anyone managing that project actively, the documentation is terrible, there is so much work to be done, to the point that these things usually just don’t magically happen, there’s a lot of top-down work. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it stresses the fact that even though our hotness algorithm, the commenting, the sorting of our comments, the thing that make things like IAmA and TodayILearned and AskScience possible, that magic sauce that makes Reddut comments not suck, unlike YouTube and all the rest that make you doubt humanity, is publicly available! You can Google for that algorithm right now and see how it works, I just wish more people would copy it, so we could sue them. No, I wish more people would copy it.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Karma system, and admittedly the Hindus and the Buddhists get credit for it, but Steve and I were Slashdot [slashdot.org] users. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Bram Cohen:</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Well, it’s this more general thing where if you have something with a model that isn't based on copyright fundamentally, that whether it's open source or not winds up having very little effect on how it’s run. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad Burnham: </span><span class="c0">Although the fact that it's open source creates a kind of safety valve for a community which knows, for the same reason if I'm contributing to an open source project, I know I can fork it if the project goes off the rails...</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Clay Shirky: </span><span class="c0">T</span><span class="c0">he value's in the code, and I think what Brahm is saying, for a lot of these things, once I've internalized the Karma system, I don't necessarily need access to anyone's underlying implementation. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is back to Joi's "The Internet is a belief system". There are some things where you need the underlying, you need the Linux kernel to do a bunch of things, but when you’ve understood what Slashdot was doing, Reddit’s Karma systems is a significant...I mean Slashdot was a Rube Goldberg machine. It was just layers and layers, both at the level of the actual Perl and at the level of how the overall system worked. It was better for you guys to fork. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad Burnham: </span><span class="c0">To s</span><span class="c0">tart from scratch.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Clay Shirky: </span><span class="c0">To</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;ideologically fork, rather than to fork the code. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>So</span><span>&nbsp;Tim I’m going to ask you to talk a little bit about O'Reilly which is, I think, a lot of people say "well, wait a minute...Kickstarter, Reddit, O'Reilly...but, you know, you created O'Reilly. You had a different vision. And you've always approached the question of ownership of copyright or at least the ownership of property interest in a different way. And so I think your company, even if it was started a long time ago...I don't know how long ago. 1983. Has a set of values embedded in it that are in some ways similar to the principles that we're talking about here.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim O’Reilly:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">Yeah, well, the first thing I would like to say is using the framing metaphor of networks: We are a network. It's not obvious, but a publishing company, unlike, say, a steel mining company, or whatever...I suppose any company is a network to some extent, but, you know, most of our product is created by people who don't work for us. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">A very large network of people who contribute, not only the people that write the books, but tech reviewers and the like...we have thousands people speak at our conferences. Our product is the product of a network. You know, it's sort of curated in an old school way. It is not as dissimilar as it appears. And we have done a lot of things that are similar in that we very early on, for example, like published our contract on the web when we first started publishing in 1985. We said, These are our terms, you know we did a lot of things that were proto-techniques that have now been used later.</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I think there's another piece, you know when I started my business, I didn't start it to make money, you know? I started it with a different value set. And I think it's kind of an old-fashioned notion of...I have brother-in-law, who works for like a third- or fourth-generation company in Chicago that makes signs. And he once said to me, You know my dad is an old fashioned businessman, he doesn't think about making a profit. He considers “How many people does he keep gainfully employed” as the measure of his success? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they're struggling in today's economy, but that's his metric and I think my original business model was interesting work for interesting people and it's that notion of valuing what you do to together more than the output, the financial output I think really, is an important element of all of this. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We bought into this big lie around capitalism particularly the sort of corporatist capitalism. That, you know for example, companies have an obligation to make as much money as possible for their shareholders and it's just wrong and, you know, I think a company that operates on the principle that says, No no, we're building something here that is by and for all the participants. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think that changes the way you think. And of course it changed the way we do business, you know when we you know, in our early publishing, yeah, a lot of it was crowd-sourced. I did a book in one of our first successful books was on a technology called UUCP, an early networking technology, and we had, you know, a pretty little-used computer conversion technologies mainframe. You know, it was not like the leading edge computer. We didn't have access to a lot of equipment and I need the first edition of that book, based on what I knew, and then people would send me an "Oh, yea. Here's how you do it with an AT&amp;T 5610 port contender,” and I'd drop that paragraph right in the next edition. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We had hundreds of people contributing useful information into the books, and so because we were focused on just creating value for this community that we were part of, and not on thinking about that our primary output was our profits. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">John Perry Barlow:</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">There are a lot of companies you can say this about, who have grown up to be quite financially successful, who became successful because they forsook the scarcity economy assumption because they knew that they weren't in it for the money. Turned out there was a lot of money in not being in it for the money. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad Burnham: </span><span class="c0">Patagonia comes to mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">John Perry Barlow: </span><span class="c0">Yeah,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;there are many of them. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>But Mark you are coming at this problem of creating an entity, and organization, a company starting as a non-profit but creating products. And so you’re looking at it from the other side. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Mark Surman: </span><span class="c7">There are lots of these things, and the thing with me, throughout the history of Mozilla and interesting to this discussion...and the things that I won’t go into are the open source piece of it. There's lots in there, but I think everybody knows that, and there's the distributed decision making, and transparency and openness and all that stuff. And there’s lots to be learned from that. And it was that stuff that drew me to Mozilla three years ago. Because it really is an organization that has a lot to teach the world and also a lot to learn from others in terms of how that openness and open source piece works. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">The thing I didn’t know before going to Mozilla, was really...there's two, intercoupled things I didn't know is how much the idea of building a set of values into a set of products that people would like was at the center of the strategy. And it was both explicit and kind of bumbling at the same time. So that’s part of, I think, what's most interesting. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">The values piece of it is Here’s this group of Netscape refugees...it's actually a great story where a guy who had been laid off from Netscape, he was a product engineer in Paris, and was in this kind of therapy session after you're laid off, with all these other people who have been laid off. And everyone’s going around like in AA and saying, Oh what are you going to do, I’m going to be a chef, I’m going to go back to art school...and he [Netscape engineer] goes I’m going to set up a &nbsp;nonprofit that’s going to beat Microsoft. And everyone kind of laughs at him. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">But this was like the Genesis of this organization, right? They had this open source code. They have $2 million from AOL. They got a little bit of money from Mitch Kapor, with ten staff and a community of people who have this holy mission to protect web standards. If you go back to the California corporation papers in 2003, it says Mozilla exists to guard the open nature of the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">So right from there is this idea that it's coming from a set of values, a bunch of very idealistic people, and I think what's interesting to dig into deeper later on that is, that's partly a real set of, you know, a real statement of values and it is partly about preserving the value in the network. So in Mozilla the project before AOL divests itself has got this big volunteer community. And if we do it as a non-profit, if we proclaim this value, we're going to keep that asset of the community and people are going to keep contributing and believe in us. So that's the one part of the decision. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">But, you know, that part of the decision on its own, I think, certainly Mozilla would have failed and we’d all still be using IE6. Because the thing that they started out with and hung in that, at least the first year was this very crappy Mozilla suite that was the...outgrowth of the Netscape suite. It was this big, bloated piece of software, wasn’t any better than IE6, they’d been working at it for five years, wasn’t going anywhere on the market, and there was a kind of an internal fight over “Do we do the leaner, meaner thing?” which was called Phoenix, and then called "Firebird," and then called "Firefox," or did he just keep trying to incrementally improve this big Mozilla suite. And the idea really was that if you want open source web standards to really have an impact on the market, you've got to make something that people want. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">You've got to make something leaner, something faster something that had a bunch of product features that people want, like blocking pop ups, and various things like this. So there became a very specific strategy about Lets make the most attractive product in the market as a way to drive these values into market. So it was about bringing web standards back through that. And that was a six month fight to get to that point and I think that in terms of what I think of as Mozilla’s biggest peer production victory, if you think Mozilla’s biggest victory overall was pushing web standards back into the mainstream amongst web developers...the biggest peer production victory that comes from those two things really is the marketing of Firefox. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">And so an organization that has got a quarter, now, 22% of the total market share, 500 million users on its product and zero marketing budget...part of that is Internet economics, a bunch of companies here don’t have big marketing budgets...but it was that combination a thing that if I was amongst the faithful, the people on this side of Jamie's collection over here care about the Net...I'm excited about this. This isn't Microsoft, this is open source, I know what open source means, but if I’m just somebody that doesn't care, like my brother or my uncle, this is a good product it actually works better so when I go and install that computer and keep using it. At the same time you might install Red Hat Two on your computer for the GUI, or even Ubuntu today, it's not going to stick. So that connection of the values and the quality of the product with this evangelism army was a really important thing to look at. Having that magnetic piece the people really want to us is really central. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>S</span><span>o I’m going to ask Cindy to talk a little bit here in a second, just to reflect on those four quick overviews of companies that were values driven...Tim’s company not really included in this but the others to a large measure are dependent on the existence of an open web...and obviously there are a series of examples of companies where they are doing a better job of using an existing asset, like spare bedrooms in the case of AirBnB or spare cars in case of RelayRides or things like that. There are also examples of companies that are creating rapid innovation by empowering the edge that threatens the relatively slower innovation amongst the incumbents. The incumbents are...I have to go back to Clay for this... </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Clay ??: </span><span>I</span><span>nstitutions that work to preserve the problem which they are the solutions.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>That’s what they're doing and they're doing it fairly effectively, and as I mentioned I would like to have Larry talk a little bit about the techniques the way in which the set of problems is related to politics but before we do that I wondered if Cindy could talk a little bit about as the matrix... not The Matrix, but the thread index, the set of things that you see coming down the road that threaten the openness of the Internet and threaten the ability to create the kind of companies that you’ve just heard about. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.rog909bqz0lq"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Cindy Cohn:</span><span class="c8 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Well </span><span class="c2">I guess I should start by saying that at the EFF [Electronic Frontier Foundation] we tend to think of ourselves as 80 percent reactive and if we're lucky we get to spend 20% of our time as proactive. So, I'll start with a disclaimer, which is that I don't know what's coming down the road. And so, what we try to do is, think about, well, what are the necessary conditions so that we can be flexible and respond to what comes next. So, thinking about having, and that's why EFF is an institution, we don't just show up when there's a problem, we're actually there in-between so that when there's a need that comes up we're already there. We can move much more quickly and hopefully much more thoughtfully than if it had been ad hoc every time. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Some other things we're seeing, so we're looking forward, the first observation that we're working with a lot these days is what we call the weakest link, which is the recognition that the Internet is made of layers, and technologists all understand this. But what we're starting to see is much smarter attacks at different layers of the Internet. SOPA/PIPA for the technologists, one of the things that was most scary about it was the DNS level attack. That wasn't actually where we ended up talking about it, when we started talking about censorship, but recognizing these layers and recognizing that the people who who are trying to to control the pace of change are very well aware of the layers of looking for the weakest link, so in Wiki-Leaks we saw them go after the payment processors, right, as really, I think, a far more effective at shutting them up than at the other layers...and that’s not a layer of the Internet, but it’s a weakest link though. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It's not just the technology layers of the Internet, but that's one of them, and then there's all of the other pieces that are in place. So trying to think creatively, trying to recognize when a threat is coming in and at what layer, what the weakest link is that it’s going at is one of the things that we're trying to do a lot of. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Thinking a little bit now....and by the way I wanted to talk about two kind of two areas where we see this a lot, and two laws that are really important because we’re bashing laws and I bash laws all the time: One of them is CDA section 230, the Communications Decency Act, which protects platforms from being treated as speakers for almost all claims, which I think there's a huge thing that supports platforms. Obviously Craigslist sits on it very strongly. Reddit does too. But we’re beginning to some some threats coming at CDA 230, and I think people should start thinking about that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">[murmuring]</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Noises... there’s no bills [acting CDA 230] yet, and it's coming from a disparate group of things...the housing discrimination people are making noise about CDA 230, the sex trafficking people are making a lot of noise about CDA 230, and we’re going to start to see some coalition, but because it serves a broader incumbent protection versus lowest barriers to entry...The voice of the person complaining about it isn’t the only thing to think about. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The other [law] is, of course, secondary liability and to the extent that DMCA [Digital Millenium Copyright Act] have been a tremendous platform protector. We've been fighting a long time at trying to protect those borders that of the safe harbors and also recognize that just because it's a safe harbor doesn't mean that you're liable if they don’t exist. But I think everybody and that's an easier one to see now, because it was so front and center with SOPA/PIPA, which was an obvious try to re-institute those lines in a way that favored the incumbents over the new people. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;know I think that we should talk about monopolies a little bit, both the kind of walled garden situations where it's difficult to leave...How do you deal with network effects? How do you create a competitive space in a world of really strong network effects? The law has not really grappled with this very well yet, I don't think. But I think it's going to be coming. We're going to have to start thinking about how do we create...Are we going to reinvigorate the laws of competition to get at this problem, or are we going to do something else. I think there is a way in which the whole network neutrality fight was an attempt to get around the fact that anti-trust law doesn't speak very well to some of the network problems right now. And, of course that creates collateral issues. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And then, of course, the two core things, censorship and surveillance, and they know that are the issues that we think end up getting created. You know, "Who gets to speak?" and you know, "Who's being watched and by whom?" are the threats that continue to go because I think that in terms of, you know speaking up...</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I'm sorry...Now I'm never gonna be able to think of Save Plumbers for Freedom without thinking of Mario Bros.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">[laughter]</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But those are areas and you end up shutting off people's either willingness or ability to participate in this great peer-to-peer participatory function if they're being surveilled too much and it’s having consequences in their lives where there’s a censorship issue. So many things devolve into these two core values. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>Thank you. Larry I was wondering if you would talk for a second about if that's a framework for a set of threats we're seeing, that challenge the freedom to innovate on the web and a lot of those are coming from incumbents who have existing business models to support and they are pretty effective. Why is it that are they so effective? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.u29xfhh51pfq"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Larry Lessig:</span><span class="c8 c13">&nbsp;</span><span class="c13">I’m a little hesitant to speak because </span><span class="c13">there's a lot of teachers of mine in this room, on the Internet and of other subjects, like economics. But the teacher of this for me is Jim Cooper, who has been in Congress, he is one of the youngest members elected in the history of Congress and as old as he is right now that means that he’s been around as long as all but 20 other members of Congress. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">And I think the first thing to recognize which he taught me is how the place has changed. It's easy for us to think that we have problems that we want to talk about or problems that have been there forever, and on some level they have, but we've seen the kind of, you know, hockey stick here too. And the hockey stick here too is the radical increase in the kind of influence, the economy of influence that produces the type of problems that we're talking about. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Now I uses words like ‘economy of influence.’ Jim summarizes the problem in Congress is that Capital Hill has become a farm league for K street. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">[laughter]</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">It’ a much more compelling way to understand the problem. And not just a farm league for K street not necessarily just about members but increasingly staffers who think of their life as a business model focused on a life after public service, their [future] life as a lobbyist. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">The part that I want add to the story though, you know...and I think in this group it could grok well...is the instability of the system that we've produced. And one way to see it is this: the Constitution hands out a resource in a democracy that we all have, called the vote. And that resource, the Constitution says, must be absolutely equal. So if your district is architected so that your vote is .1% bigger than mine the constitution says we gotta redraw your district so that our votes are exactly equal. And those votes happen in discrete moments. We have a primary, we have a general election. In those discrete moments, we all are equal and the product of that equality is a very conservative (with a small C) system. Radical change has done happen overnight because you got to convince a bunch of people to support the change and having to convince a bunch of people from all across society is a really valuable thing. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Alright now contrast that with the second election that we conduct every two years, that's the money election. The money election is the election which we conduct, where people give their money to candidates, so that candidates can then run their elections. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">And the thing that, you know, has happened slowly, and now much more quickly since Citizens United is the concentration of influence in the money election. So .26% of Americans, one quarter of one percent of Americans give two hundred dollars in a congressional election. .05 give the maximum amount to any congressional candidate. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">.01, the one percent that the 1 percent get more than $10,000 dollars in an election cycle. And .0000063%, [that is] 196 Americans have given 80% of the super PAC money in the presidential elections so far. 196 Americans. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">So what that means is, if you look at the graph for votes, everybody's basically equal. If you look at the graph for money influence and it's basically nothing till you get to the very top, and the tiniest slice of the 1% is having this kind of influence. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Now, why is that a problem? Well, it's a problem because the instability that it produces for the democracy. Because what that means is: whenever you have an issue, that you'd like to block reform on, block change on, where there's an incumbent and that incumbent would like to stop anything that gets in the way, it's a relatively small number of people that you've got to recruit to your cause. A relatively small number of funders are going to be sufficient to get the money you need to steer policy away from this kind of change. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">PIPA/SOPA was an amazing victory at the end of a series of 20 years of defeats. A series of twenty years of defeats, because in the system, they could concentrate influence so much with this money, that they could block, they could protect against the emerging Internet, because that's just the economy of influence that system has. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">AT&amp;T, you know, the outrageous things going in the context of Internet service right now...Jim spoke about people who do not have access to broadband. Some states like, you know, North Carolina began to have the communities that provided broadband service by community organizations. They would set up these broadband community organizations. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">This broadband service was symmetrical fiber service. So North Carolina was the worst state in the nation, the symmetrical broadband service was cheap and fast when it could be provided. Last year, exactly a year ago, North Carolina passed, the 19th state to pass a law, basically banning communities from doing this. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Why did they pass this law banning communities from doing this? Because AT&amp;T and Verizon have spent unbelievable amounts of money to get these state legislatures to stop this new competitor. And the point is, they can do this because we've created a political system where the tiniest slice of Americans actually get to call the shots. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">And the only way to avoid, to go back to a system, where it's a broad swathe of Americans who get to call the shots, so you don't get this kind of steering by a tiny group of Americans is to begin to disaggregate the money-power game the way we disaggregated the voting-power game. Democracy solved the voting-power, somehow we've got to solve the money-power. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">But until we do, every single thing we care about, and not just we in the Internet space, but everything we care about in global warming, health care, a tax system that makes sense, it's going to continue to be susceptible to this highly unstable influence market that we have allowed to evolve over the period of just the last twenty years. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8 c13">&nbsp;</span><span class="c13">Jim</span><span class="c13">, did you want to add anything to that? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Jim Cooper: </span><span class="c13">Larry said it better than I can, but the past in general is overrepresented in Washington. The future has no lobbyists, so how do we create them? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Brad Burnham: </span><span class="c13">I saw Larry a few weeks ago, and he actually told a very poignant story about the fact that he was not convinced that there was a solution to this problem. And yet he was fighting the problem. And one of my goals today is to see if we can crack his conviction on his part just a little bit, that there may be some thing, some tools that we can begin to play with here would, without necessarily requiring that fundamental change in the way we finance politics, create a counterbalance, and I think we did start to see that with PIPA/SOPA that there is the possibility that some of these networks can actually reach out to the users who are emotionally invested in them and recruit them to do something. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And Mark talked a little bit about designing products in such a way that the products recruited users...and we’ll come back and talk about that. But before we do, I wonder if we could spend a few minutes trying to sort of...Cindy’s outline of the threats, I wonder if we can sort of organize the agenda for, the positive agenda that we'd like to promote. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I wonder if we can just go around the table. I mean we've been thinking about this, we've been talking about this, and I think that there are issues around the open web, there are issues around the, you know, the future of the governance of the web and where that's going. There are clearly issues around a neutral network - and we can come back and talk about that more specifically. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yochai has done a ton of work on unlicensed spectrum. We don't - as I said there's not really a good lobby for more unlicensed spectrum, there's a lot of money being spent on controlling more spectrum. Let's talk about what that means. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Obviously we've talked about intermediary liability and copyright. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There's a set of issues around software patents things that have become a real nightmare for those of us who are involved in young companies. There's a debate that I've had off and on with Mark about the possibility that there is a role for the vertical, as John says, that if we could get the government and to think about the ecosystem they create in the same way that Yancy are thinking about creating a set of rules that empowers innovation as opposed to...actually that defines a role that an individual can play. So that's regulation, but it's not oppressive or sweeping. It's very targeted. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There's issues around identity. And then finally, issues around data ownership and privacy. And I wonder if we could just throw that open and say, Are there other things that I've missed in that list that we should add to that list? Are there things that I threw out in that list unnecessary because technology, for instance, will solve it? Without requiring us to think about it from a policy perspective? Are there some things that are more important or less important? Jeff? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jeff Jarvis:</span><span>&nbsp;It would </span><span>be dangerous to get down too specific at this stage and say that what we want to preserve is the uncertainty of the future. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>Okay, so then, should we not deal with this list and deal instead with principles? Or should we deal with this list with caution?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.1lgurz7mqw2m"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jeff Jarvis:</span><span class="c8 c18">&nbsp;</span><span class="c18">I would argue that what we have been dealing with in great measure this morning, and what we have to deal with, is that we have to have a discussion on the level of principles. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">Because every time we get down to specifics, everytime it's Rupert Murdoch saying But you stole this movie, right? And you're in the weeds then and it doesn't do much good whereas I think we have to decide what the principles are but also to decide and to sell the benefits of those principles. The fact that jobs are created and culture is created for people like that, that matters. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">I think those principles include a right to be connected, and if you cut off that right, it's a violation of your human rights. A right to speak, act and assemble. We deal with right to privacy, I would argue. We deal with the notion of what is a public good, we deal with the idea of transparency and that becoming the default of our institutions. We deal with the idea that all bits are created equal, and that's net neutrality. And we deal with maintaining the architecture of the net so that it doesn't...[so that] no one can claim sovereignty over it. Those are the kind of principles that I argue for. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">They're the the wrong list. We'll never agree to one nor should we ever agree to one, but if we don't have this discussion on the level of principles then we don't have anything to call upon when the attack comes. We don't have anything to point to and say, okay Google, personally, I'm glad you got out of China finally, but I'm really pissed at you - and I'm a Google fanboy - for the devil's deal you do with Verizon and in turn with the FCC. Where's the principle we point to and say, Yeah, I can put that under the evil category, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">We have to have that discussion. But it's not the only discussion we have. But if we only have the discussion based on tactical goals then we don't see, as Cindy said, what's coming out there that we can't even see. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Bram Cohen:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>The goals are prosperity, human rights, and democracy, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Fred Wilson: </span><span>And b</span><span>lazing broadband. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>[laughter]</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">??: </span><span>Same thing. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Jeff Jarvis: </span><span>And freedom to do the fuck without want I want to. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Bram: </span><span>Human rights. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Steven Johnson: </span><span>Yeah. I agree with Jeff, I think that focusing on and defining the values is be what we should try to figure out to do today with our time, but I'd just add that a domain that we haven't fully looked at, we just alluded to it briefly with participatory budget so we talked about peer networks, obviously the private companies that develop peer networks, and protest movements and various other things but whether states can actually be organized along peer network structures, and Beth has done more work on this, I think, than anyone. But think about taking this incredibly top-down hierarchical structure, and thinking about reinventing it along these lines as well, as being a place where these values could actually potentially be embedded is something I would want to have on the table as well. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Mark Surman:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>If we're going to stay making that list, because I think we should go back to the values, I think there is a piece around. I don't want education broadly on the table although I think it gets disrupted hopefully by all of this but specifically education around the Internet and what illiteracies are of this space that we're trying to promote. And I think it's off everybody's radar, there's a huge process going on right now to find secondary school computer science illiteracy looks like, which the web is almost absent from both here and in the U.K. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so that is very directly a policy kind of process. It's about, in the U.K.case it's an official national curriculum, and the kind of ideas that we're talking about are completely outside of that. And certainly all of the big incumbents are in negotiating for what that curriculum should be. So I would throw that into your mix, as well as underlining identity and data. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Craig Newmark: </span><span>I would like to see some movement toward specific real things we can do that actually might get results. Conversely, that being dangerous, I would like to complement Brad that by listing the attendees of this conference he has started off a good draft for an enemies list for K street. You wonder when I'm joking and being serious huh? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>So Craig, t</span><span>angible things. What, I mean I think that frankly...I'm, you know we spent a lot of time this morning trying to work toward a common language and common understanding of a current framework thinking about the problem, the method that you know, Yochai’s 12 dimensions. But you know, and I think it does make sense that we wanna actually end the day talking about specific ways in which we can encourage an evolution of policy that favors innovation. The kind of innovation, the kind of openness and freedom we are talking about. And so, I wanna get to these tangible things. But I wanna know, you know, I'm gonna push you to help us define what you mean by tangible, what kinds of things? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Craig Newmark:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>Well the whole SOPA thing </span><span>was something real wherein the sleeping giant of the Internet community was briefly stirred. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Uh, pretty good. What's next? Is it CISPA? Is it something else? I'm looking for stuff which gets people in the internet community, and probably a lot of millennials, in the habit of working together to make these things happen. We have a chance to accelerate that. The effort does need to be protected somewhat. On the other hand it may happen more spontaneously with just a little pushing. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I do not know. I'll just do my little bit to do pushing like the statement here earlier, that Congress is just the farm league for K Street. I just push that ad out to my networks, which may have a result. So I don't really know, but I'm a customer service rep, and I think in terms of the grass roots and from there pushing up.</span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.cazv6n2kxn98"></a><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8">Clay Shirky: </span><span class="c10">Many of my heroes are in this room and I came to be in the room, but I really came to propose one thing, to get your guys' feedback. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">It's an idea some of you may have heard from me for a while and I'm thinking about doing it. And it gets at exactly what Craig is saying, which is the Internet volunteer fire department. I think a mistake we could make with PIPA/SOPA is to say "Oh, my God. Now millions of people want to be activists." They do not want to be activists. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">They want to watch kittens on a treadmill. That's their job. Our job...</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">[laughter]</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Free downloadable kittens on the blazing fast bandwidth that we are adding to the list of human rights! People don't want to be activists. And when activist see active people, they think "Oh, finally they are converted." This is happening right now, people running all over our politics saying my issue is worse than SOPA and they are mystified when people don't instantly propose an internet blackout. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">So, I am proposing an Internet list.. email, but better SMS, in which we would go to the broad net populace and say, "Our pledge to you we hope we never have to email you." We promise never to try to educate you or explain anything unless it is an existential threat and then it's just going to be a for alarm fire because what happened with SOPA and PIPA was ... We had a meeting actually with Chuck Schumer afterwards and it was clear that part of what was going on was that they [Congressional representatives] were just disoriented. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">If we set up a predictable way of saying these are our issues and these are the resources we can reliably marshal, we are just part of the system. But if we say, "There's a big red button.” In addition to all of the other actors, and I'm proposing anybody stop doing what they're doing, I just think there's a giant collection of people who would say I'm not gonna ever sign up to be an activist. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">But, if there's an existential threat, I will turn out again. And then create that list and hopefully keep it in abeyance, but to be able to say to the people in Washington, here's the heuristic. Ask yourself if what you're doing fucks up the Internet. If the answer is no, as you were. If the answer is yes, a million people are coming over to your house. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8">Crowd: </span><span class="c10">Who presses the button? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8">Clay Shirky: </span><span class="c10">I don't know. I think it is some small group of people, I do not think there is any institution. I think it is like five to seven people. I think it has to be personal trust. I think it has to be here are the - it could even be one person. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8">Tiffiniy Cheng</span><span class="c10 c8">: </span><span class="c10">I mean, I'm not saying it's me. But I'm saying that there were 24 million people who got engaged in the SOPA/PIPA fight and that means did more than read. They actually acted in some way. And I think they may not be ready to be activists, but I think we should say to Washington that we should continue to fund the space that helps to activate people around to these existential threats. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">But I'm saying that they are. They may not be active all the time, but they are a political constituency, a new one that has been built over many, many years. It's made up of young people who see the Internet totally different than we do. It's their music, it's their fashion, it's everything. And they will join this Internet League. They will join what we have which is the Internet Defense League, which is very, very similar to what you're talking about.It's a new political constituency in the sense that we have new values. It brings together the left and the right. It's sort of this libertarian, liberal mix, I would say, and they can be a force to be reckoned with because they will fight for their interests. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">I do think that the political alignments are different with Internet issues. and I think there's real political essence for what the Internet affords and that's the platform I think we should run with and try activate people. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8">Clay Shirky:</span><span class="c10 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">Right, I agree with all of that about the political alignment. I don't think that most of the people who are active on SOPA/PIPA will be casually active around anything less than an existential threat. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">I don't think and I think if we try to educate them or politicize them, we lose them. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8">Tiffiniy Cheng: </span><span class="c10">Well, I think that, you know, Move On [moveon.org] has I think is it five million membership, and they cycle through another of fifty or five hundred thousand every year and people are...I shouldn't really say this out loud, but in any case...people on the Internet want to be tickled by new technology. They love the SOPA/PIPA fight cause they're worth sort of there were these tools that sort of, you know, explained exactly what the protest was and was also effective. I think we need to continue innovating. And I think the Internet defense league that we're trying to build is supposed to be that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We want to rise up creatively every time, and we want to make a promise to the people who sign up that, OK, We promise we will only email you 10 times a year. Only when there's some big threat, and we won't go over that. So, then, we know how to ration what we do. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Bram Cohen: </span><span>But is it a mobilization thing or a marketing thing? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think the deal with SOPA and PIPA is people understood what it meant to them and that's why they got excited about and that's not going to translate into believing the people who told them something about SOPA/PIPA that something else is important. There needs to be new marketing about other things, and in particular, the thing that strikes me is the thing of the list of things that Brad said. The one that it seems to objectively, should be the one that has the broadest base support across everyone, is the one that's the least sexy, which is software patents. Because unlike most of those other things, software patents are absolutely ruinous in purely economic terms. They're horrible for a society and the world. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>They're not actually benefiting business at this point anymore. They're benefiting patent trolls and patent lawyers. And so it seems to be like everything is in place to have just broad-based, "OK, we're going to kill the patent trolls," and have some real reform around it, but it just isn't happening and I think a big part of that is, aside from the term “patent trolls,” which is a wonderful term, the anti-marketing around software patents hasn't really happened and still to the extent that people understand much of anything around them anymore, they still think of software patents as being innovation and technology, when they're nothing of the sort.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>So there's an interesting, you probably seen what Twitter did last week, a week before on software patents. The reason I bring it up this context is it's a technique that I think we should think about more broadly. What Twitter did - and I'm not gonna get it exactly right - they basically empowered the original inventor to decide how that patent was going to be used. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So, the big the problem is that they're still abstract but they can cover anything, they wipe out entire businesses. But when they fall into the hands of trolls they turn into nuclear weapons because they can use them to go after whole industries, but if the inventor of the patent was able to have, essentially, what Twitter offered, which is a license to the patent which they could then turn around and offer to anybody they wanted. It took away, it gave the inventor the power the to take away the value to the troll. And so it empowered the edge. It empowered an individual. Now we don't know how it's going to play out and maybe its naive and that sort of thing. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Bram Cohen:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>It doesn’t really fix the problem of patent trolls. Patents are like in some way have these deep, deep issues, which in the case of software and even more-so business methods, just makes them fundamentally broken. There's no independent inventor clause in them, that you can claim a patent on something which...</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Brad: </span><span>I do agree, but okay. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c15">Nick</span><span class="c8 c15">: </span><span class="c15">Okay, so we're talking about what we can do on the Internet that's uniquely powerful, and so we've learned how to yell with SOPA, PIPA and the volunteer fire department of the Internet Defense League that is institutionalizing that ability, right. That's awesome. And the Twitter patent thing is a hack around the system, like a clever hack and we should think about how we can create more of those hacks and propagate more of those hacks. But, if I can call on you Naomi, I know that you're fuming because there's... we can't yell and stop everything on every threat that's coming. &nbsp;And for every SOPA that we nail and for every CISPA that we miss because it's not quite a SOPA, there's like 50 other things that are brewing, because there is influence in certain places, and so, in addition to doing these other things that we have to do, what else should we be doing? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c15">Naomi: </span><span class="c15">Well I'm not fuming, but I guess when I'm listening to these wonderful sensational ideas something that I do feel like I need to kind of put out, for my better or worse experience working on two presidential campaigns and looking at how influence actually happens on the Hill, is that there's more and less effective ways to put pressure on the people who are going to be making the decisions that you're referring to. And I think it's important to keep in mind. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">One person tweeted very wisely, picking up from what Jim said, the future has no lobbyists, how can we create them. And I know that it's really visionary and beautiful to not engage with the system at all because the system is totally corrupt. However, I do need to say I think that, you know, Cindy said she doesn't see the future, but I think that the future is pretty clear if you look at the history of other closing societies, which I think we're in. And so I would say, going back to this race against time, you guys have about 3 to 5 years. And so the way to push back that horizon and do the things you need to do is there are some minimal things, this is like safe sex, that you can't engage other things without having in place.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">So what I want to say is that people on the Hill are not free. They're prisoners too. Jim Cooper's colleagues have to sit there for 4 hours a day dialing for dollars, and because there are 196 people writing the agenda, and they have their lobbyists -- you know -- Al Gore is a wonderful guy, and I worked for him, and he wanted to give childcare to, you know, the women and men of America, but he said until you guys form a lobby I can't do it 'cause the Chamber of Commerce won't let me. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">So, what you all need to do is harness this fantastic energy, but it's not all equal. E-mail is shooting back and forth, or e-mails going to congress don't necessarily make any difference. Protests don't make any difference. It depends who and what these people are. But two little things will make a huge difference. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">One is your congress person. You are like a nuclear bomb is how one consultant explained it to me. If you can show up, or show up online with 30 to 50 to 100, that little, registered voters in that person's district, who vote congressional elections, 'cause no one remembers to. And then if you organize that way, and you organize the organized bits that way that you guys have the power of networks to do, then you can say to all these different representatives will, and you can make a meeting with the district officer, they'll give it to you because you are now at coalition. You know, that you can say we'll get out the vote for you in the next election if you sponsor this bill, or if you move this through. And the other thing you absolutely need to have I'm really sorry to say it, but it's on my conscious, you need your own lobbyists on K street. And you need, like these guys are gonna kill you. Like they know, like Cindy said, they know what you're doing. You know, I actually said, I think some of the discussion should be off the record at some point, because they are going to be watching this. They are going to be like "Oh, that is what they are up to?" Great we will get this lawyer, this lawyer and this lawyer to stop them first. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">So you should think about starting a Lobby. Lobbies don't have to be evil. The Sierra Club has a lobby, the AARP has a lobby, you know, not all lobby's are evil, and Emily’s List</span><span class="c22 c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">is a lobby. And having a lobby for freedom on the Hill, and you can do everything else, and then you'll be unstoppable. But without all of these things, you won't be nearly as effective, but with them, you will.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c15">Tiffiniy Cheng </span><span class="c15">We worked with Jamie White during the the SOPA PIPA fight. We were only really effective because we worked with groups like PK and EFF, who know the legislative process. And what really scared, from the research that has been done on the SOPA-PIPA fight and conversations with people on the hill, what was effective was all of the different innovative ways that people were fighting on congressional turf. So we did on-the-ground meetings, where people actually, every single office, got thousands of calls from constituents. People defected and came out against the bill after that and on Reddit people raised fifteen thousand dollars for our candidate to oppose Paul </span><span class="c15">Ryan</span><span class="c22 c15">. </span><span class="c15">T</span><span class="c15">he SOPA PIPA fight was effective because of the legislative dance that was happening, and that was spinning creatively in all different directions on the Internet. So I think it was tuned to the legislative branch.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c15">Naomi Wolf </span><span class="c15">That's great, but what I want to warn you is that SOPA PIPA, we're going to be looking back on that, and thinking "those were the days" because they are not going to soft until they close you guys down. I have to say it, and they are going to get more and more sophisticated. And so what I think you need is to own your own congress people. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">You know, we’ve got some software that shows who gives money to whom -- let me just finish. If Congress is relying on AT&amp;T, or relying on the people who benefit from not giving the other players access to protecting these freedoms. They're not free to listen to, no matter how -- you know, fifteen thousand's nice, but AT&amp;T is giving them twenty million, so if you actually are raising money, crowd-sourcing money, tapping your own high net-worth individuals funding it officially to your own lobby and your own lobbyist who can then fund it to the campaign to specific Congress people who are willing to be owned by you effectively, then it's a real thing. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Brad:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>Yeah, let me get Jaime because he’s on the Hill and then, I know Yochai wants to say something and then Mark.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Jaime</span><span class="c19 c8">: </span><span>Yeah, a couple things, I think in terms of specific things that we got to be working towards. I think process really does matter, and the reason we sometimes get bad laws is because the process on Capitol Hill can be so flawed, and it seems to me that our challenge is to have a Congress that is as open, as collaborative, and as trustworthy as the web that we want and advocate for, and I think that Networks actually can help us do that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Networks enable members of Congress, in real time, to basically see polling data. You can see things trending on Twitter, you can see the post on Reddit and what it does is that you don’t have to rely on your leadership, your political parties, pollsters to tell you what's the popular thing to do or not. I think there are a lot of ways in which networks can help break down barriers to members of Congress to be more collaborative to people they represent. That's one key thing we’ve got to work on. I'm not as pessimistic as you or as Larry. I think that over time the networks themselves will bring change and we don't have to have lobbyists on every single issue. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And the other thing I would say is, it might be helpful for us to identify those laws that have created a framework that we think really does work to facilitate an open web. Section 230 is one of them. If we can identify those, I think it is important that we export them. The Motion Picture Association is certainly trying to go overseas and work with, you know, the trade representative and others to get the US signed-in to treaties and pacts that constrain us. We’ve got to be using those same mechanisms to have laws, like Section 230, exist elsewhere so that when our firms go overseas, or we have speech that happens overseas, it’s protected from liability. We ought to have things like trade agreements, or disciplines, in our trade agreements that include a binding right to move data across borders. To often the technology industry looks to Washington when it has to. What is happening is that some of the technology industry is in Washington, and now they are just getting the idea that they might want to look overseas, to figure out what is next, where their next battle is coming from, and we might want to help. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Yochai Benkler</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>So this actually ties very closely with to where I was hoping to push a little bit. There's something on -- it's essentially in between these two extremes, the one that Clay and Tiffiniy were talking about which is way or well, even they weren't in exactly the same on the spectrum, let's block this emergency and stabilize the emergency power for ten times a year it a lot more than just emergency [xx] and on the other hand, Naomi's push to sort of regularize and build it into the system. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There's the question of whether or not, given how veto-rich the system, in addition to being very money-rich, it's also very veto-point-rich. If there are a particular toggles that can be bundled into a cluster, such that if we were able to flip the toggles on those, it would be very hard to turn them back. So you have not so much an ongoing politics, which is important but very difficult and also not just an emergency veto, but a moment in the same way that 1998 was a year in which the copyright industry succeeded in flipping several toggles their way, in a way that we're swimming out of already, whether it's changing the definition of criminality, which is enormously destructive, whether it's lengthening the term of copyright, whether it's the DMCA and anti-circumvention, a whole bunch of things happened. And since 1998 until now, there is a chunk in the Internet’s life that we have been operating under that set of legislative successes.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">So the question question to my mind is can we come up with something along the lines of an Internet freedom pledge at the level of what people can understand. Here is a set of four things that if you want to be a candidate in any congressional district, if you want the support of people on the left and the right, do you support the Internet freedom pledge? Some of us need to then come back and say this translates into, and then we can have the conversation specifically about what it means about software patents, what it means particularly decriminalization, de-funding from pro-IP and reversing Grokster and getting back to Sony. There's a whole bunch of things that several of us, and organizations not in this room have done, to try to put together, and not all of them fit, but put them on a very short process, using the energy that we already had. If you thought -- I am going to do this it's terrible -- if you thought SOPA was bad, here’s the good thing. Here's the thing you can do that's positive, and if we can flip those toggles and make it into something that is hard to argue against, and we make sure, and this is one of the things I think there are real tensions, that one of the powerful things was right and left were able to come together. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There are areas that have to do with trying to understand regulatory role of the state in resisting the power of monopoly and incumbency that really makes it difficult to do right-left because you’ve got a right concerned with the state as a locust of power that is willing to live with market-based power and you don't have that in more progressive view. So that could break the thing, but I don't know. I think that's a conversation to be had. Very real, a very real conversation to be had -- what’s that Internet freedom pledge one time that we can flip those toggles using the energy now, the other side is going to say - and international agreements is obviously one of them, and then their transparency - that it'll take years if any for the other time and by the time of which the net has moved forward and innovated around the models. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Brad:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>Let me get Mark in here, and we'll come back to Greg.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Mark</span><span class="c19 c8">&nbsp;Meckler:</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span>I want to work backwards from where you left off which is personally the idea of the right and left coalition. That to me, and </span><span class="c10">one of the reasons why I am here, is that it is fundamental to what we are talking about. And we have a completely broken paradigm in this country, in my opinion, which we look at everything because the politicians and because the big corporations encourage us to do this, we look at everything from right, left, Democrat and Republican; and Republicans are supposedly free market and Democrats are big government status. Neither of those is actually true, and the bottom line is, most Republicans and most Democrats are big government, big corporation State-ists. They play in a spectrum about that wide, and the rest of us probably exist somewhere outside of that spectrum. So first to me, the primary goal is to break that paradigm so citizens realize that we do have a two party system: it's the incumbent power structure versus the citizen. It is not right versus left, or Democrat versus Republican. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">That is what allows people with divergent views to sit around a table like this and not use labels, and if we can't get past that, then in my opinion, everything else we're talking about here can't happen. And that's a big task: it's a cultural task. It's not a particular piece of legislation, it's not a branding issue, it's to get it out in the culture. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I heard talk about “we have to own our Congressman” and “we have to own our own Lobbyists.” I’ll go back to my ranch and ride horses before I play that game. I can tell you my experience working with activists around the country. You can shake your head - I understand the practical reality of why you're saying that - but true or not, that kind of language will lose 90 percent of activists. They will go home to their ranch, to their store, to their job, to their church, to their family because we find that idea repulsive, as citizens, and we don't want to engage in that.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Naomi</span><span class="c19 c8">&nbsp;Wolf</span><span>&nbsp;Can I speak to that? It's a beautiful, beautiful statement of values, and I respect it, completely. I think we are in crisis, and I clearly see it differently than many of the people in the room. I think we don't have luxuries that we used to have, and that five years from now we'll be looking back at this time and even being able to have a conversation like this, unless we act now and think that was a luxurious time when we still have these freedoms. I find it's actually not difficult to mobilize activists and mobilize them effectively, and I find that if you explain to people of all walks of life and educational backgrounds, what you mean by “let's have a lobby for freedom” or “let's have a lobby for the constitution,” all of which are things that I have a successfully done with my activist base online. They get it and get behind it.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So what do I mean by lobbyist? The current system is evil; it is completely corrupt. But there is an organization called Mom's Rising out of Seattle, which is a lobby working moms, and most of them are lower middle class, pink-collar ghetto, they have a terrible set of policy opportunities because no-one cares about poor women and low-income women, no one cares about moms and dads who are trying to balance it. And the Chamber of Congress, going back to what I said about Gore, was able again and again and again to just capitalize on the fact that they were not represented by anyone in Washington, who was pushing for their interest. What is a lobby? A lobby is just citizens, ideally, getting together to put pressure on their representatives, and unfortunately since Citizens United, it also involves giving money from those citizen in order to level the playing field a bit from these really evil people, who have their own evil lobbyists, who don't want citizens to have their own lobbyists and their own lobbies. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so again, I think of AARP. Old people in this country are better off than they used to be 100 years ago when people would die on the street of old age because of a group like AARP, which is a lobby. So, it's a horrible word, let's come up with a new word, but I hate to say it, I don't want to represent this perspective, but I know from years and years and years in Washington, helping to get two presidents elected, watching how it works, years. And from sources on the Hill, who steadily confirmed this, as well as my own experience as a reporter that you can do all of these wonderful things, waking citizens up, but if you're not represented with people who can push back, represent citizen's interests in a cross-party coalition, this is all going to be theoretical, because they are going to pass laws, and they're doing it every week, to keep you from being able to have the freedoms that you think will protect you from what they're going to do in the Hill.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Nick Grossman:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>Okay. I’m just going to read a question off of Twitter, if I can. This comes from Andrew Rasiej. He says, “here’s an idea for Hack Society, elect someone using only the power of networks and no money, and you will be able to change everything and save the open web.”</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Jeff Jarvis:</span><span>&nbsp;Can I interrupt here just because--I emailed with Andrew to be able to say what his meaning was last night, here in New York. So here you go, quick description. Where he believes that there's an opportunity, and Jeff Jarvis speaking, but I'm speaking for Andrew here, and if I get it wrong Andrew tweet fast -- 'cause he's listening -- that he is trying to organize what he calls a Hack in the political systems’ strategic strike and believes that in New York that if people can get enough people registered, you can win the Democratic primary -- and I forget which, but that’s the one -- because it's New York, and that it goes to the open pledge, that it’s not a party, but it is a belief in open government and an open Internet and so on. And that he wants to see if he can do that. He also says in the email, not one single sponsor of it is going to lose their seat, even though the bills were shelved. He said the way to solve this problem is to prove that networks are more powerful than money, and start electing people who believe in the open web, open democracy. Now imagine doing it with no money.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Naomi Wolf </span><span>&nbsp;I need to say one more thing, which is if you organize your networks powerfully enough, which given the power in this room, you can do in a month, you can create a lobby to pass legislation to get the money out of politics, and then I think you would be happy. And so would I. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Craig</span><span class="c19 c8">&nbsp;Newmark </span><span>First, I'm trying to think if it would be a clever approach of Yochai’s pledge by calling him a Grover Benkler &nbsp;or Yochai Norquist</span><span>. &nbsp;I do think it’s a good idea -- t</span><span>he rub being in who decides what those principals are.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>What Mark says about the ordinary person's interest in this stuff is accurate, speaking as a customer service rep. People are busy, often single moms raising two kids trying to get them to school. The deal is he will get people's attention when there is an existential issue, which is why Clay’s message framing is really important, because we are talking about the, let's say, the metaphor of an Internet volunteer fire department. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>That kind of statement plus some of the other things that are going on this statement is more suitable for the conclusion of this effort, but the deal is we need to be pumping out the idea that something is bubbling here spreading that proto-meme out to our entire networks, because we do want to make something happen. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I'm biased towards only thinking the bottom up approach works, and so that's what I've been pushing out as well as Squirrels for Good, but that's a different effort. So I can only encourage everyone to start doing this, and I'll be looking for good summaries of this effort to start pushing out in a big way.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">John</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Perry Barlow: </span><span class="c0">Yes, somebody once said that politics is about two things: money and I forget the other one. Somebody once said that politics is about two things: money and I forget the other one. I actually would say that “the other one” is the narrative and anecdotes. I mean, Capitol Hill, most political processes live on anecdotal reality, and we have held up our, we have disdained, involving ourselves with people on the Hill in a conversational way. And we have failed to show the economics of our way of looking at things. I mean, I know that Yochai has actually been incredibly helpful, and there are people like Paul Roemer, but we haven't really made a good case for our own economics, and I think that it's time we started doing so. Because that narrative has been completely controlled by the content industry and others like them. We can start changing that, but we actually have to go up there and engage. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other thing is that we do have a demonstrated capacity to raise a lot of money. I mean, when Obama was elected, I thought this is the sea change in American politics where a guy can get elected president with small donations, and it is not owned by the fat cats. It will turn out that he was owned by the fat cats for some reason, but you know, the model has not since been followed in those littler campaigns that actually make the difference. For the house, for local seats, and we really need to do some thing about that. We can raise money in small donations. We have the great capacity to do that, and we have the great capacity the engage these guys if they'll actually take the trouble to do so. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, I was really embarrassed to have a conversation with Pat Leahy the day after the SOPA bill went down. He was completely baffled. First he wanted to know why since we're friends, why I hadn’t talked to him before, and I said "Well, you know, I didn't think it would do any good." And then he showed me why it wouldn't have done any good by telling me a whole bunch of completely misleading anecdotes that had been given to him by the content industry and we could have substitute those but we didn't want to. It is beneath our dignity. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Brad: </span><span>W</span><span>e really need to begin to think about telling stories that illustrate the values that we’re trying to promote. Larry, you were trying to say something. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Larry</span><span class="c19 c8">&nbsp;Lessig?</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>I mean this as a friendly response to Naomi. We can't frame this as if the question is “do we do politics” or “do we not do politics.”</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think the point that I was trying to assert, building on what Jim has tried to teach, is that the current version of politics that we have is broken. And it's not broken because we have lobbyists. As John Edwards used to say when he used to quote John Edwards, there's all the difference in the world between a lawyer making an argument to a jury and a lawyer handing out hundred dollars to the jurors, right, and our lobbying system does not understand that difference. And as long as it doesn’t understand that difference, there is a fundamental fact about the incumbent versus the future. That's Cooper's point. The incumbents are always going to have more resources in that fight, and they will always be able to exercise their power. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Luigi has a fantastic book called "Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists," which is all about the way the incumbents will always have the resources to block the next generation innovation unless you build into the system the kind of restraint that make it so they can't do that, and the current system of funding makes it impossible for us to build in those restraints, so I agree with you on your last statement where you say let's get together and figure out how we can change the way we fund elections, but that seems to be fundamental, because until we do that, these other things just, you know, they're kind of nice things to rally and build lists around, but they're not nice things to actually solve problems, and even, you know, Clay, and Tiffiny, I love to idea of let's have a team to rally when we have urgency to rally, but you know, PIPA &amp; SOPA was just a clumsy legislative action by the MPAA.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>They're never going to be that stupid again. So they'll continue to play what they want to play, but they'll never do it in a way that will be viewed as an emergency that would get people so excited that they'll do it again. But that doesn't mean - I’ve talked to environmental groups - I do not come in and say look give up your work on the environments and come join us on the campaign finance fight, right? No. You know, keep the -- I like Yochai’s pledge. Keep the pledge. Here's what we think. Here's our number one thing. This is what we want. But I want issue number two on your list. I want the number two issue that you recognize, the second most important thing you care about is building a democracy where lobbies of citizens, broad range of citizens who--I'm with Mark, I want to spend most of my time at home with my kids. I don't have a horse. He's got the biggest horse on the market -- but spending time at home with my kids is what I want to do. I want very rarely to have to come out in lobby. I want a world where I can trust that, you know, you have lobbyists who are arguing about what makes sense and that’s basically what's happening. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Until, we can only get that world if we can fix this underlying problem. And if we can get every group, the Internet people, the environmentalists - God bless them, - the Tea Partiers, all of them to say our number two issue is to get to a system that's not corrupt...</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">new person, interjection, Naomi Wolf</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span>is it an action step if I were to tell people on my Facebook page to support Lawrence Lessig's “what” to reform the campaign funding system? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Albert interjection</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>Well, I think the question is, is the action a specific election to target, or a specific candidate, as opposed to the trying the larger form in one go?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Larry Lessig </span><span>Yeah, we don't have a candidate anymore, right, we had that candidate, and you were just talking about how excited we were when he was elected and he was going to quote: “take up the fight to change the way Washington works, because if we don't take up this fight, then the problems we face, that our children face, are exactly the problems that we face.” That guy, what was his name? I can't remember. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Fred</span><span class="c8 c13">: </span><span class="c13">Larry, I’ve got a question for you: </span><span class="c13">How much money will be spent in the Presidential election this year by both sides?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Larry:</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;Two and a half billion dollars. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Fred: </span><span class="c13">Two and a half billion, and that includes the super PACs? Okay. How much how much is the Internet advertising business right now? Forty billion? Fifty billion? Forty billion a year? Okay. If the Internet decided to take three percent or four percent or five percent of its ad inventory and make it available for free because the reason they raise all this money is to buy television ads, right? and instead, if the Internet industry said, you know what, fuck television, we're going to make 5% of our inventory available to candidates.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">new speaker, unknown? </span><span class="c13">I have quite a bit of ad inventory, I don't know what to do with it. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Larry</span><span class="c8 c13">&nbsp;Lessig </span><span class="c13">I think its looking at the wrong side of the problem. The side of the problem you've got to look at is not where the money is being spent then, it is the effect that is having on the candidates. So if you spend thirty to seventy percent of your time raising money, the question is who are you raising money from? And if you're raising money from the tiniest slice of the one percent, regardless of how much money is being spent, you know, if we could cut the spending by one hundred, it would still be the same dynamic. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Raising from the top one percent, top fraction of one percent, then you're going to be more sensitive to the fraction of one percent than you're going to be sensitive to the broad range of Americans. And this issue about small funding, there's a really amazing Congressman from Maryland, John Sarbanes, Paul Sarbanes' son. So Sarbanes presented this to me in a really compelling picture of what this problem is. He says the biggest thing people are afraid of is 30 days before an election a Super-PAC comes in and drops a million dollars on the other side. The problem for the incumbent is at that point they don’t have anyone to turn to because their big contributors have maxed out, so who are they going to turn to? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">And he says what most people are now doing, is that they're buying Super-PAC insurance in advance. And how do you buy Super-PAC insurance in advance? You basically signal to the Super-PAC's on your side that you're the loyal kind of person they want you to be so that when a million dollars is dropped against you, they'll drop a million dollars for you. This is a protection racket, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">So Sarbanes says, “I want to build a different system. I want to build a system where I have small contributors.” But he says, “it makes no sense for people today, to a congressman today to try to raise small contributions --i makes no sense at all.” So he built a legal structure where he's raised seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and he is not allow to touch that until he raises a thousand small contributions. So this money is already in the pot but until he raises a thousand small contributions that doesn't come into his campaign, but his whole idea is that if he has a thousand small contributions, then when somebody drops a Super-PAC bomb on the other side, he can turn to his small funders to get them into the campaign to help him fight back. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">But the point is, the current architecture of funding would never make that sensible for a Congressman to do, which is why they spend all their time talking to, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Brad</span><span class="c8 c2">:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I want to see if we can step up a level and throw out something provocative. Luigi, you've done work in looking at the way elites control politics and the economy, and also, you've looked at the things that undid that. And as I remember, what generally undid that was free trade. Right? How did that mechanism work? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Luigi: </span><span class="c2">Y</span><span class="c2">ou know, I think that, I have to say, what works in smaller countries, I don't think it works for the United States. The reason is that if I'm a small country and my institutions are screwed up big time, when there is free trade, I can't compete...</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Brad: </span><span class="c2">You can’t compete globally?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Luigi: </span><span class="c2">Exactly.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;So there's a natural pressure, to sort of change institutions to make them better...</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Brad: </span><span class="c2">To compete globally?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Luigi: </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yeah, globally. I don't think that works for a country as big as the United States, also because the United States has pretty big power in setting the rules across the world, so these are the rules that are most convenient for them to play, globally. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Brad: </span><span class="c2">Let's throw out a thought exercise. The Internet isn't geographically constrained in the way that a lot of other things are. If there were -- what I think of as an Internet Enterprise Zone, a place in the world that created a policy framework -- and we can all imagine what that policy framewrok would be -- it would conform to Yochai’s four principles. It would actually drive all the way down to the specific implementation steps that we've talked about a little bit here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And then they built a hosting infrastructure, a server infrastructure, and they said send us your data. What - if it’s possible - that we could create an environment where the political system in the U.S. all of a sudden recognizes if data starts moving off offshore, and if services start being hosted offshore, and if I no longer control access to that DNS, and if I no longer have a right within my legal system to go at and get that data, or to survey that data, and that economy started to grow, wherever that economy was, would that create the kind of competition that forced the elites to give up power in the smaller countries that you mentioned? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Luigi: </span><span class="c2">I think that's an interesting idea. You want to create a Delaware, instead of a Delaware of Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Brad: </span><span class="c2">Yes. That's the plan. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">John Perry Barlow: </span><span class="c2">We started trying to do this in Iceland, four years ago. Then they went further than simply thinking about it, but they didn't, they didn't get all the way. They didn't get past principle to money. They didn't get past the idea of defending openness online by having a safe haven for bits. What they needed to do was to realize that there was money to be made in having a safe haven for bits. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Brad: </span><span class="c2">I know Yochai’s been thinking of this -- Iceland, specifically. </span><span class="c2">I just want to specifically mention that I was there last week, and I met with a number of politicians there, and I had a conversation very similar to this with them. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That particular country is going to go through an election next year. The current politics in that country are such that the people that control the state today are the ones that came in after the collapse, so it was sort of a reactionary election. There's some tiredness around the electorate around that group, and there's some talk that another group that will come in. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The really interesting question is that there is a multi-party coalition around us than understand the economic development argument, not as a political argument. They do have the natural resource, essentially free power. They have now built--and I saw a couple of these--very sophisticated hosting centers. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They have really good connectivity to Europe, not very good connectivity to the U.S., but they are 315,000 people that have a real incentive to create an economy to supplant the one that crashed. And I'm not suggesting that Iceland is the place to do this, but if anyone did it, would it create a forcing function globally? Would it begin to make it look less palatable for any political elite to impose a set of constraints that would hurt their economy? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Yochai Benkler: </span><span class="c2">So, I would be wary of moving our energies in that direction and that hope. I’d say that the best example of a situation where internationalization of a core functionality provided a real threat was the encryption battles of the 1990s where the concern that, initially you had the U.S. trying to block encryption research with back door blocking encryption export, and as it looked like the business of producing high-end encryption was moving to Germany and Israel -- and various other places -- they gave up. More than the politics, because that was the worst of all possible worlds. You can't make them give up. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Bram Cohen: </span><span class="c2">The weird things is the laws are still in the books. Technically speaking, you're not supposed to send crypto to Iraq still, and everyone does anyway. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Cindy Cohn: </span><span class="c2">That's a really long conversation. I think it's fair to say that in the main, we won that battle. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Yochai Benkler: </span><span class="c2">And the main reason that I did focus on Cindy and the EFF was because I was trying to use that as an example, not of successes of internal domestic constitutional law, but of arbitrage Internet -- global arbitrage.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">new speaker, JPB</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;And a case that we never made, and probably ought to is that commerce on the Internet would have been severely crippled if we hadn't been able to get that restriction taken away. You know, I mean, billions have been made.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Brad: </span><span class="c2">So</span><span class="c2">, I think that the point that I wanted to make is just that having read Luigi's book and understood, at least, the way I understood it that is was more an economic argument than a political argument that forced a number of these elite economies with political systems to open up. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And I agree that it’s not the people in this room shouldn't be going and trying to identify an Internet Enterprise Zone and then working that set of politics, but it may emerge naturally. I mean, there are a number of economies around the world that understand this value and could create it. And the point that I think it illustrates is the possibility that, yes we need to fight all the fights that we're talking about domestically, but ultimately, if we begin to see economic value shifting offshore, we may have an easier fight than we think. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Yochai Benkler: </span><span class="c2">The only concern that I was -- beyond the focus -- is the question of the extent to which, if the kinds of services -- so the attractive story is -- there's this data haven, this is where businesses are going to set up. We're worried about businesses leaving. But then the question becomes how much these businesses need to connect to someone? And if the issue is on the side of the connection, and you have already developed an approach that attacks the DNS system, attacks the payment systems, puts people in prison, uses drug seizure laws for DNS, et cetera, then it's not clear to me that simply being physically beyond the jurisdiction with your server will be enough, either to draw the business there, or to allow the business to go there to still maintain the economies of a market here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That’s the difference that I see with the encryption where you're actually do the full development elsewhere. As long as you need to continue to create a platform for the hundreds of millions people here, you're still stuck within this framework.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Albert Wenger: </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;It goes back to the earlier discussion that the value of the network accrues to the network, not to the company at the center. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">So if Etsy were in Iceland, Etsy's value is in the Etsy marketplace and that marketplace has to exist elsewhere -- it has to </span><span class="c2">exist primarily here. The ability to connect to that marketplace is not there. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Mark Surman: </span><span class="c2">I mean, there's still another--what is it? 6.7 billion customers elsewhere. It’s hard for me not to boil up, as the Canadian listening to an hour and a half, and as a person who runs an organization where, you know, by far the biggest portion of our customers are not in this country, by far. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I guess I would turn Yochai’s caution down a little, bit but really support what Brad’s saying in that you don't want -- there are important political fights to win here, there's no question -- but to think that all of us need to agree on a political strategy and certainly to agree on tactics, like, that's crazy, and I don’t think anybody is suggesting that. So I think that's a great thing to try, there's probably a business case to try it, but try to kind of either just think that the fights here are the most important fights -- they aren't -- or that this is the only place that matters -- you know, it doesn't. But that's the thing to kind of stay away from. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And</span><span>&nbsp;I guess the other thing is, if we go back to the environmental movement example, thinking that politics is the most important question is also the wrong thing, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The environmental movement no longer thinks that Washington is the most important place to be. In fact, one of the things that came late to the game into the 80s and 90s before is it saw that the market, was another lever and that personal understanding of consumer practices is another lever.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And one of the things that I think we often forget that this a group of people, who as advocates for a particular set of values and ideas, have been tremendously successful. It’s been through market disruption that we’ve been successful. Any other movement would envy us to say that in twenty years we’ve taken our values and blasted them into society in a way that has toppled over the encyclopedia industry -- you know, where we were able to bring web standards back to the fore in a way that the court couldn't, you know, the anti-trust courts I think had a much more limited effect than what we did in the market. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I would say we don't have to agree on what these political strategies are to think that they are important. They are part of a suite of things that we need to do around a set of values. We don't have to re-do what we do here somewhere else. The whole world is going to really shape what this is...</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad: </span><span>I’d really love to stop on that positive note. We do have, it is a little bit after 3:00, we we said we're going to do a fifteen-minute break at three. I'm not wed to that. But, you know, why don't we just take a couple more comments and then we'll go to break. Mike and then Tiffiniy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Mike</span><span class="c19 c8">:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">I think some of the challenge is also the fact that a lot of this discussion it is like can we come up with a universal solution, and I'm not sure that's ever possible or even necessarily desirable. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This idea of like can you create this Internet Economic Zone, or whatever it's called, that's, again, I think the problem you pointed out is you can solve one part and then other things are going to be a problem, but I think some of those things do start to solve themselve, and just as an example of that, you know the software patent problem that has been brought up a couple times, in Amsterdam there's this effort underway called Appsterdam. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I don't know if anyone's familiar with this. But they literally looked at the insanity of the software patent situation specifically for app developers and said we are going to try and build this zone that effectively protects app developers and trying to convince US and elsewhere app developers to move to Amsterdam and work on building apps, knowing that they wont have to deal with this kind of software patent claim. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">So that's an example of a very, very narrowly focused version of that, but potentially could drive other places or other countries or other, you know, regions to say that we need to change if we're beginning to lose developers to that thing. That's targeting a really really narrow problem. I think that that is the type of thing that can be more effective than trying to solve everything in one single shot. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Tiffiny</span><span class="c19 c8">:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>I basically agree with that. I think there are two hopeful fights that we have, that we have been talking about in this room. One is the Internet Freedom Pledge fight, which I think if we cast a wide enough net and we represent a broad enough set of possibilities like the SOPA/PIPA fight, people will take it on and try different strategies and try different things, and some of the best stuff, or some of the stuff will win, and some stuff won’t win, and that sort of reflects what the Internet is about -- you know, the stuff rises to the top -- and i think we should all throw up our ideas out there and see what rises. And we could even have a place where these ideas go. And I think everybody should try different things. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And then I think the second fight is what I ultimately care about is how </span><span class="c13">the Internet that we want and that we want to protect and expand and fight for is what money out of politics look like. It’s the possibility of having, of actually protecting, the vote and participating in a vibrant political system where some of the best political ideas rise to the top, or you know some of the best candidates. And I think we reach that by -- I don't know how we reach that -- but what we do with the Internet fight can really change the money in politics question, because maybe we can show, you know, what a more democratic, democratically led, and publicly enforced fight for a fair political system looks like. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Public financing, I think, would be a great experiment that looks like the Internet that allows people to have equal resources to become candidates and to affect the political system. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Fred</span><span class="c8 c13">: </span><span class="c13">So money is just a proxy for getting their message out. And the Internet is the most efficient vehicle ever invented to get a message out. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">If you go back to my point that if you just took two percent or five percent of all the Internet advertising that is sold every year, you'd be talking about more attention dollars than will be raised through the entire system. And maybe you tie access to those attention dollars to the Internet Freedom Pledge. Meaning, you get a consortium of the largest and smallest Internet companies to all contribute a certain amount of their advertising inventory to a pool that's only available to those candidates who take the Internet Freedom Pledge. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Steven Johnson: </span><span>No, the other way to do it, building off Larry’s idea... No. I am little concerned how this has gone from Hacking Society to “save the open Internet,” which is a great cause, but I thought we started on a bigger scale. Larry has two Benjamins and one Franklin, what is the...?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Larry Lessig: </span><span>Franklin, yeah. The Grant and Franklin Project. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Steven Johnson: </span><span class="c13">S</span><span class="c13">o basically the twist on [the Grant and Franklin Project] is that you can get access to the 5% pool of Internet access, if you renounce traditional fundraising. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Fred: </span><span class="c13">Ah, so it's more than that. You're talking about opting out of the system. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Steven Johnson: </span><span class="c13">Yeah, you get this magic pool of money and access and whatever, as long as you don't take any money from traditional sources.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Larry Lessig: </span><span class="c13">&nbsp;So you did the Internet entrepreneur version of what I was talking about as a kind of public funding proposal. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">So my public funding proposal is, you know, take the first fifty dollars all of us contribute, quote on quote, "contribute" to the government treasury -- and we all do, contribute at least fifty dollars in some form -- send that back, take my 50 dollars back as a democracy voucher, and then I can give my democracy voucher to any candidate who agrees to take only vouchers, plus contributions of up to a hundred dollars per person, so “Grant” and “Franklin.” </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">Okay. What you have done is you have described a privatized version of that. You’ve said, okay let's create a fund. The fund enables peoples to get access to this money, if they pledge maybe Yochai’s or your Internet pledge, plus, they give up, you know, they don't take money from the other stuff. Now fifty dollars of voter turns out huge amounts of money - it’s seven billion dollars -- which was three times the total amount spent on the last congressional election. But the point is that it would be money where trying to get money from everybody as opposed to a tiny, tiny slice. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c13">Steven Johnson: </span><span class="c13">I think the Internet pledge would be a distraction. As much as I like that idea, but I think because because I'm now a Root Striker, I feel like that hat's a big enough problem on it's own, and arguably the bigger problem is that it should be purely about reforming a system of campaign finance, and here's a way to do it without actually having to pass a constitutional amendment or pass a bunch of laws. You could just create this amazing economic incentive in a private sector that people would opt into because it would be all this free money. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">JPBarlow:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>The problem is that you've got politicians raising money to advertise on broadcast television, in broadcast media, to a voting block -- that while it's diminished and diminishing -- is still a block that they can count on to vote a certain way. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I mean, the Internet cannot be counted on for any particular block; we’re everybody, but the continued television audience is pretty highly defined, and they vote. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Larry Lessig:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>It</span><span>'s not just the television audience. I mean, the reason why the Tea Party was so successful in 2010 is that though they represent 20-30% of the public, they were 40% of the vote in 2010. That's what I'm getting at 'cause they turned out to vote. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">JPB:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>Yes. They do.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Kahlil</span><span class="c19 c8">:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">I was a little concerned that for a while, the conversation was focusing on about 700 people, and that would be all those who were elected to go to Washington and then it's 183 people who can $10,000. I think that the direction that the conversation seems to be going in is the place where I found myself in launching this organization that I work with, and that is that people are relentlessly -- they are impatient with the slow pace of political change in the country. Some people express it, as I said earlier, through gerrymandering, other people talk about campaign financing and other things. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And what I am hopeful about this community, and I guess this really goes to Mark's point, is that the ideas of... In my belief, people in politics and people who get people in politics elected, therefore the people who are allocating resources on behalf of the American people and others, react best to pressure. And they react to fear. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Their fear is that they will lose their spots, that the money will stop coming, that there will be an equalization between the people out there, and they who believe they are vested to be able to make the decisions. So it is incumbent upon this group to make sure that they are thinking about themselves as a market that will put pressure on these people -- not just to get a better piece of legislation where the commas and the semicolons are in a better place etc, etc., But that the tools that we use, whether it be through advocacy, or new technologies, or the creations of social entrepreneurial organizations or for profit organizations, that the pace of creating those organizations and getting the best and brightest people to come in to work on them -- instead of working for candidate X or presidential candidate X or Congressman Y -- that they are actually working outside of that system to put constant pressure on the people who are inside that system. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They can go back and forth, but it’s the market that solves all these problems. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19 c8">Brad:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>I know Beth is also lined there, and we'll finish off with Nick and go to break.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Craig Newmark: </span><span>Can I suggest that on behalf of this group, contact the Super-PAC for a Better Tomorrow, tomorrow to get their Super-PAC fun pack.so that we can start our own? So seriously, it's a serious point. I know Mark is working with a PAC that has a very specific agenda. We are talking about the creation of a PAC. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Well I was only joking. Yeah, we're not. And so having a tool, you know, complementing all of the other things that were said, accepting the reality that we live in today until it gets changed, makes perfect sense. Beth, you were going to say something. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Beth</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Noveck: </span><span>Maybe this sort of tees up the next conversation who wants to be the person between everyone in coffee, but our office I think the conversation obviously is now is kind of going in somewhat two directions we might come back into one that focuses exclusively on the politics and the other that seems to be a more diverse set of reflections on what does it mean to actually hack society. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And </span><span class="c7">what's interesting to me about the group people this table, is these are all people who know how to work with law policy and technology to effect change. So the example that given much earlier that you brought about Twitter is kind of hacked to the software patent problem. It's an innovative thing that can be done or built or created in order to solve the problem. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">I spent an hour yesterday with Todd Park. And if anyone around the table has spent an hour with Todd Park, you know what a just totally delightful day it made yesterday. And he told me a great story which I think is relevant here. So we're chatting about, I sat down with Todd and you know we've been telling this story for a year or two years about how releasing open data and building a bunch of apps is going lead to changing the economics of the healthcare system, but there seems to a bit of underpants gnomes in between. &nbsp; There seems to be a bit of underpants gnomes in between, so it's like apps, underpants gnomes, healthcare all great and wellness at the other side. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">So what's going on with that middle bit in the story was actually happening in the last 6 to 12 months. And he said, well, it's interesting. He said open date is really the catalyst. It's the absolute necessary injection that's provided through government intervention, but it's also the little known part of the affordable care act which actually provides that the new innovation center at medicare has a ten billion dollar R and D budget, people may know this or not I wasn't fully aware and its the innovation center has the right to test, with data, new ways of paying healthcare that will improve quality or cost, if it works to improve wellness then HHS can scale its authorized for whom may be scaling the change with purchase of the legislative interaction.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">So he said that is the little hack in the Bill, the little thing that we could build or do, that really has the potential, combined with the open data and the app development to really lead to changing the economics of healthcare to paper wellness instead of paying a fee for the service, so I'm gonna just sort of raise the question about things that we can actually build. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">So there's a set of interventions that relate to what are the things we can do to create our own fund PAC and really sort of lobby in a new way and engage with the incumbents but the question that I would ask for the next session is what are the different things that we can build, and from Twitter, Alex Howard mentions, he says, "What about we need to build a wiki for implementing open-data policy in New York City, for example. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">So he's pitching his particular issue here which is "What is that wiki that we can build?" I'm spending all of my time now in building the Wikipedia for firms and corporations, because I believe that if we don't have corporate transparency about who owns whom, we can't do any other things that we're talking about. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">So I think this question coming back originally it might have been Steven who said or maybe it was you Brad who talked about the goal here being enabling groups at a local or national level, whatever is on the web, to set a goal and accomplish it together. What are the kinds of things that. What's the sort of basic tool kit of stuff that we can build, some of it legislative, some of it engaging with congress to fight against censorship but some of it is about fighting for promoting those positive values, and I would sort of ask what are the five things we actually need.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">One of the basic kind of backbone on the technology side, on the policy side, on the legislative side that we should be thinking about?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Brad</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span class="c7">I 'll throw out one thought that is consistent with the Twitter hack on patents, which was essentially trying to devolve the control over the patent to the creator, to push it to the edge,and another thing that goes back to the notion of where your data is that mightan impact is if services were to provide a toggle for their users that said essentially "Where do you want your data?" Onshore, Offshore; US, Iceland. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">You know, and if they provided that toggle it would allow users to express, essentially, a sentiment about the direction of policy that might actually cumulatively create some impact, so it's again the hack is not requiring policy to be changed, but rather just exposing sentiment, and I think there's probably a number of things in the basic principle, pushing to the edge the ability to voice something. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Nick, you were anxious to get a thought out there. Can we take a 15 minute break? We're a little bit behind, Just tell the people on the audio stream when we're coming back. In 15 minutes. And it's 3:23 now, and I can't do the math, but it's 15 minutes. 15 minutes. [xx] </span></p><h1 class="c1"><a name="h.r0gbn84qe74m"></a><span>Session 3</span></h1><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad Burnham: </span><span>All right, we're back. I've been told I do not know how to tell time. I'm on my many other weaknesses. So, we have only about an hour and a half together after having spent much of the day poring through a lot of ideas, issues, that I think most of us care deeply about, and exploring a lot of different sort of nooks and crannies, sort of the parameters of the problems that we're grappling with. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This last hour and a half, I want to do a couple things. I want to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to sort of reflect on what they've heard and they hope we will take away or do as a result of having participated, and and to that's a goal that we're going to have to leave some time for at the end. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But it's we also wanted to spend this last bit talking about things that we could do that would sort of push the ball forward. And I think that we spent a bunch of time talking about whether or not there are some ways to affect the economy in a way that would would sort of guide the politics of the issues. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We talked about directly engaging politics, and one thing that we haven't really, we talked about a bunch this morning, when we were talking about language and definitions is developing the narrative. And I think that a couple people mentioned to me over the break that we could do a better job of of developing that narrative in a way that organized the activity beyond this room And organized our own thinking. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so I'd like to ask Tim to sort of jump in on that 'cause he was mentioning it over the break, that we kind of lost the thread of understanding whether there were data-driven and stories that could be told or, you know, a broader narrative that we could incorporate into the pushing the policy forward. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.ygf7tot12gu"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;O’Reilly: </span><span>I guess I would just start by saying that </span><span class="c6">one of the most effective things that we can actually do is change the framing of how people think about the Internet. And we started out this morning with this discussion of these networks and the notion that there are networks that work by different rules than traditional hierarchical businesses. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The next that seems to me to be to create some narrative that quantifies the value of that for society. And I.I 've been thinking a bunch about the hidden economies of the Internet. That ranges from traditional economies that are financial economies but really aren't that well for example, by policy makers. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">So they don't really know, you know, what is the size of the YouTube economy, for example, when you're talking about piracy and you say, well, was saying here's this copyright economy, and there's this sort of uncopyrighted content economy, which also has size, but we're not really comparing apples and oranges in growth rates. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">There was one piece of it that is simply, you know, different business models, and one is invisible. But there's also another aspect that I think we've touched on in a couple of the conversations, you know like right after lunch, when we talked about different companies that have been focused on different values. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">I think that we should flesh out that narrative that has run like a thread through today. And start to put some horsepower on to quantifying it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">And I think one piece that I've been fascinated by came back to mind an article I read, you know, a frighteningly long time ago in 1975 called the Clothesline Paradox. And it was about solar energy and the notion that, you know, we put our clothes in the dryer and collectively that adds up to some amount of energy that we measure on our utility bills and collectively as a society adds up to our fossil fuel You know economy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">We take our clothes out hang them on the line. They don't get moved to some kind of solar, uh, ledger. They just dis- here. We don't measure them at all. And it seems to me there's a lot of economic value on the Internet that is like that clothesline paradox. So if you look at somebody pays you know 60 bucks to their, to the cable company and watches you know, cable tv, it would be recognized as a content transaction. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Somebody pays $60.00 to the same cable company and all they do is watch YouTube and Facebook and Twitter, it isn't. It's seen as them getting content for free. And you go somehow that chain of economics was interrupted, because people went off into this world where the value exchanges aren't really considered. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You know, the value exchange of YouTube is, I'm giving you free hosting and the possibility of gathering an audience, in exchange for you creating content. And people are the watching, or also sharing, it's definitely one of these networks we're talking about. Eventually there's an economic layer that gets put on top of it, but there's this huge layer of value creation that is not reflected in the dollar economics.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">I would love to sort of thinking about alternate metrics for that as an economy. If you think about the amount of entertainment hours for example, that people are getting out of these networks, and you say, well, yeah, they're not monetized yet, but we can start to measure them. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Brad</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Burnham</span><span class="c6">.Does anybody know if there are economists doing work on that ? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">I am trying to find that out. Erik Brynjolfsson at MIT says he's doing something, but I haven't actually read what he's done, so. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Fred Wilson: </span><span class="c6">Is this the same thing as consumer surplus? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Tim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;O’Reilly: </span><span class="c6">in some ways. I mean it's not entirely the same because I do think that, you know there is a whole consumer's circles argument here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">as well, for example. But what it has to do with is that there's a pre-monetary barter exchange range that goes on in a lot of segments. We're clearly exchanging value. I just think that if we could develop the narrative, it would really help policy makers to think more clearly about the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Wendy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Seltzer: </span><span class="c6">So a couple of studies come to mind. Eric von Hippel at MIT is doing various studies of user innovations, some of which is Internet driven, some of which Outside and trying to capture those things that don't show up in traditional measures of company-driven innovation. Then there's I think it's consumer electronics association has done studies of the Fair Use economy, which are half facetious comparisons to the copyright industry's studies of the piracy economy but trying to use their measurements to gather data and I think it's a great project and we should have more of them, and more different metrics, because - </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Tim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;O’Reilly: </span><span class="c6">Yes, I'm willing to work on one project of with the hosting company Blue Host. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Some of these ideas came out of the conversation with them. They were saying they wanted to give something back to the open source community because they felt they got so much value from them, and in the course of the conversation, Hardvri[sp?] Ashandra[sp?] Ari, I forget his last name, said there was some McKinsey study that said companies small businesses, they have a website such and such optic in their sales and you know the value created by a hosting company is largely derived from free software. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">So, you know, you had Tim Berners-Lee, who didn't capture the value you had, Matthew Gudenius who didn't capture the value, Linus Torvalds who didn't capture the value, but they clearly created it. And then you have a chain of intermediaries like hosting companies that did realize some of the value, but a huge part of the value is actually realized in the broader economy by the increased visibility of goods and services. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">And You know, I do think that. So we're actually going to try and quantify that, in the same way that, you know, Hal Varian did the economic impact of Google advertising. work with these guys to try and do a White Paper to look at their customer base and say well this is what we think about the economic impact.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">But I think we could do a a lot more like that, to just bring out this narrative of the, you know, the overall growth of the commons and the value of the commons to society that's been enabled by these new networks. And again, I'd love to get some economists working on how that value creation eventually spills over into sort of the more formal financial economy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Fred</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Wilson: </span><span class="c6">Well, I mean, it certainly does. I mean, there's companies that have scrapped out their exchange servers that they were paying tens of thousands of dollars a year to operate and just have moved to Google mail and either spend nothing or spend a trivial amount of money and that money then allows them to hire another person or two in their company. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">And I think I think the Internet is just full of those stories. That may be the story of the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Jeff</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Jarvis: </span><span class="c6">Or not hired. The other thing is I think, I couldn't agree more Jim, with what you're saying. I absolutely agree, but The Internet doesn't just create growth, it also create efficiency, to an extreme. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Craigslist classified, as Craig said at one point to me, [xx] I'm talking around Craig even though he's not here. [xx] But Craig was in essence a and philanthropist or classified ads. He left the money in the pockets of the transactors rather than the pockets of the middlemen.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Fred Wilson: </span><span class="c6">But that money doesn’t stay in the pockets though. It just gets spent somewhere else. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Jeff Jarvis: </span><span class="c6">Right, but I'm saying it's a difficult accounting, because we're going to have some people say, and I'm not agreeing completely, but I'm just anticipating the argument is, "Yeah, your damned Internet destroyed retail, destroyed newspapers, destroyed this store there." So you've got to have an ability..</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Fred W: </span><span class="c6">It didn't destroy anything. It just reallocated wealth to other places. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">I'm not arguing with you. I'm just saying that's the narrative you've got to make.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">It is definitely destroying the newspaper. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">But it's increasing journalism in other ways. It's making it more efficient.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Fred Wilson: </span><span class="c6">It didn't destroy anything. It just caused different forms of business to get created that replaced what that business was. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Jeff Jarvis: </span><span class="c6">And they're sometimes smaller.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Fred Wilson: </span><span class="c6">And the capitalists who owned those industries lost wealth and the wealth got transferred to other places. It didn't just evaporate. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Jeff Jarvis: </span><span class="c6">Amen. Amen, brother. I'm agreeing with you. But I'm saying this is the argument you're going to hear back. So narrative is the right word. part of [xx] that says that it creates value and efficiency in other ways. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Nick Grossman: </span><span class="c6">So this is the challenge of the Internet and of this whole problem, because in every one of these cases the blogs that you're concentrated. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">And it's represented by industry [xx] whether it's Hollywood or the newspapers or whoever. And the benefit is diffuse and hard to quantify. Exactly. And so on the one hand, you could look at that as like an enormous challenge. On the other hand, you could look at that as maybe a new kind of opportunity. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">We've been thinking a lot about what are the ways that the web can advocate for itself that are and some strengths. And one of the things that the web is good at is having lots of people tell lots of stories in different places. And so I like the idea of sparking a a storytelling meme that gets at, where is the value in all of these opportunities. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Tim O’Reilly </span><span class="c6">An</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;upgrade of something I've heard in Washington, is that besides money, one of thing that speaks our constituent stories. If you can actually get a story from a constituent, that can have a real impact. And so to me stories about, hey, such and such good happened to me because of the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Right. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Mark Surman: </span><span class="c6">And there's got to be somebody who has made money on Etsy in every congressional district. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Yeah, I mean this is, you know Etsy is a substantial business.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">I've made money, I'm a small business and you go to every Congress person. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Fred Wilson: </span><span class="c6">Right. You wouldn't just do Etsy. I think that what you'd want to do, is you'd want to AirBnB and Uber and Etsy and Kickstarter, and all. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Right, right, right. I mean they go back to eBay. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Nick Grossman </span><span>It's not just a company, like your blog community donates "x" dollars a year to Donors Choose, and that's a form of value creation in an Internet community, and I don't think we should limit that to companies. When you think about the wealth that's being created by all these kinds of thing. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Jamie is trying to get a word in edgewise. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There's something in the politics of that.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Tim O’Reilly: </span><span>Maybe I'll write a paper and get someone like Cap to put it out or co-brand so that it kind of flows into the the regular channels, yeah. Look at the size of all of these hidden economies. I'm actually toying with the idea of watching a conference called hidden economies we've kind of made of focus on how they work, what their stories are, who is succeeding. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You just can't find the conference. What? You can't find the conference room. there is that risk. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Brad</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span class="c6">So we're actually...I think Nick's point is a really central point here, and that is that there is no lobby for In Tim's example of the solar energy that's drying the clothes on the line, and there is a lobby for the electricity industry that is providing the power. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Right. and so there's this very easily measured, concentrated harm, whether it's the newspaper industry or the electricity industry, and there's a very diffuse benefit, that we need to figure out a way to aggregate those conversations, those diffuse conversations. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">I like coming back to the environmental movement here, and the environment as a model, because It's, you know, there's also this notion of natural capitalism, which is actually valuing the services that are, you know, oxygen sunlight, warmth, things like that that are provided. &nbsp; And if you had to - but we don't value those. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Jamie</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Boyle: </span><span class="c6">And that actually does lead into I think looking at the environmental movement teaches us some useful things, and one of the good things it teaches us is that almost all of the ideas that people have suggested here had a valuable role to play in the environmental movement. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.skj3aoha13u5"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c6">One thing the environmental movement did brilliantly was mobilize anecdotes so that there were there will be be a silent spring, because all the birds will be dead, right? That's a great anecdote, right? It actually turned out the science was crap, like, wasn't getting the [xx] probably crap in a way that led to significant harm to people who otherwise wouldn't have gotten malaria. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">But as an anecdote, it was amazing, right? </span><span>Burning Love Canal, the story about Love Canal, the that was an amazing set of things. </span><span>The good thing about it is, I don't think we have to pick from the strategies that we've put forward here. Because if you look at the environmental movement, it wasn't just anecdotes. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">One of the other thing the environmental movement did quite brilliantly, is it focused on really geeky, technical, economic arguments that were then really geeky and technical, like externalities, the idea of externalities. That was then really geeky, right? I mean, who had come up with the idea 30 years before, never actually used the word. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lots of economists didn't even know what it was, the idea that 50 years later, a smart high school kid would be able to understand that if you don't force the polluter to internalize the cost of his or her pollution that, they're going to over pollute. It's sort of like, well, that's just being educated. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Everybody knows that, right? One could hope that there will be a similar moment when people go [xx] peer to peer production, we’ll that’s just Benkler -- &nbsp;everybody knows that! Right? So it's not just anecdotes. In other words, I think that each of the things that we talked about, the four principles, the idea of anecdotes, these are Really important, I want to also say that we don't lose track of two things though, one of the really important and one of them visonary and one of them practical, starting with the practical. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before we can build the next generation of Internet activism, it would actually be nice to have this generation of Internet activism EFF is there everyday, and has been there since the beginning, actually working on these issues. Some of the people in this room actually have money. I'm not one of them, but you know who you are. I think they all left early. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;actually need to support the groups that are doing the things that it gave us, somebody said," well I mean we got section 230 and section 512", and I watched the number of people in the room who didn't know, you know what those thing were exactly it wasn't a majority, but I think there were a fair number of people saying, "What is that again?" </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">JPB: </span><span class="c2">That was plumber talk. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c2">Jamie</span><span class="c8 c2">&nbsp;Boyle: </span><span class="c2">That was plumber talk, right? </span><span class="c2">When I try and explain to my students that there was a moment when everybody knew that every hosting site on the web and every transmitter, every ISP and every search engine would be liable copyright, for every active infringement that traveled along their networks, they go, no. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Internet would have been impossible! Exactly. Right? Anything you said on a blog, you'd be treated like a newspaper. I.E., you'd be strictly liable for libel. No, because the Internet would be [xx]. Exactly! Right? So we need to capture those things which are our Magna Carta, our foundational freedoms - and we need to not call them Section 230 and Section 512, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Not the marketing I'm saying, I wouldn't know what you were talking about. [xx] BC is now. Yeah. We have a marketing department now, though. My point is we need backwards...we need to reteach the history don't you - there are a lot of people who just want to respond when the red button is pressed. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But there are a lot of other people who say why is the Internet possible? That's one of the reasons, because we had those things. That's a It's practical but it's focused on saving the freedoms we've got as well as hoping for other ones. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The</span><span>&nbsp;other part is the visionary part which goes to what Stephen was talking about which is Seems to be that the larger question hacking society is getting subsumed in the how we save the open net. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There is a logical reason for that it's hard to imagine hacking society successfully without the open 'net. Nevertheless is would be a shame if we lost that. So I would suggest that there's a time relationship between these, which is that some of the, "how do we save the Internet," the tactical stuff, is, OK, let's go forward and think about how we're going to harness the sopa pipa movement over the the next four months. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think hacking society might be a slightly longer time frame than that, but it is one that shouldn't get lost either. So my suggestion for what it's worth would be to have not one thing that comes out of this, but rather: if you believe that the four freedoms is the way to go, what's the next step? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>If you think anecdote memes are the way to go. What's the next step? And if you're interested in continuing - if you want to measure the hidden economy, what's the next step? And if you're interested in hacking society, because that, I think, is working, and coming up with the creative commons is one of the most exciting things I ever did. That was a private hack. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I definitely the time for. Maybe this could be generalized, maybe we could do this somewhere else. And I don't want that conversation to stop, but at the same time I don't want us to come out of the room without a to do list. And it seems to me maybe three or four to this problem, simply we're all moving to Iceland, which I personally like. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.2ogd7i7k42rp"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">John Perry Barlow: </span><span class="c0">I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have a parable I want to try to state as briefly as possible. But many years ago I was a semi-pro environmentalist in Wyoming. I was head of the only state-wide environmental group. There was the equivalent of the record industry in the form of Louisiana Pacific which had been temper minding the federal force in Wyoming and was trying to come over the divide toward my town having denuded all the slopes around the place called Dubois and they wanted to go on doing that and the people of Dubois wanted them to go on doing that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And at one point I met an economist who said and I was thinking about this this morning as you were talking about these rain forest or coral reef ecosystems where the same proton gets passed around many, many times. The economist said, "Look, if you bound the set around Dubois and around your down Pinehill where there's a diverse service mill. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will see number of jobs per million board foot is about four times higher for the diverse service mill than it is for LP, and The people do voice their concern about employment; you can get to them there. Morever, the four service you have these public input things, the problem is that you're fighting with the wrong people. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reality is that as long as there's more more money in the timber budget than there is in the recreational budget, it doesn't make any difference what kind of VISes you present. This is germane, I'm telling you and finally, he said, all you environmentalists, even local ones like you, don't let the these guys finished a sentence. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whether they're in Congress or in the Timber Union in DuBois. And you've got to quit preaching at them from some kind of high moral ground and start talking to them about economics. It's not that difficult to prove the economics and I really think and we prevailed them, I mean we chased the LP up for federal lands in Wyoming immediately as soon as we knew that</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Steven</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Johnson: </span><span class="c0">That 's why I think that it's great and I think that is Tim's idea of measuring these things. I mean I would call it the Peer Economy. And just what is the output of the Peer Economy, right? And then you can build then you throw that up and you're like, "Look at all the wealth of this extended network that's been created", and then from that point, you'd say "Where the hell did that come from? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How did that happen?", and then you have the principles that we've been kind of outlining to explain that.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Fred</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Wilson: </span><span class="c0">So, right there, I think you need an advocacy organization, peereconomy.org, you need some capital to fund the research that needs to get done. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you find the economists and other academics who have the skills to go out and do that kind of work, and you give them the funds to do that work and they go out and the do working to come back with the answers. And then that advocacy organization also engages in Washington, lobbies, and also propagates this information broadly through out the world. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think that those kind of things which we doing </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Naomi</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Wolf: </span><span class="c0">can I chime in that in this case perceived by many people as elite of person the success tend to be very people, and so this great idea of an advocacy organization that gets credibility also by doing research, not just engaging in politics. But also, I think also should hire people who can identify these users at much lower and more versus economic levels who benefit from the Internet, the small producers, the Etsy, and then let them be the ambassadors for the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Jeff Jarvis: </span><span class="c0">Absolutely</span><span class="c0">. That is a narrative. So, the narrative is informed by numbers. Numbers informed by facts by, I hate to say it, education, but education of where the economy is going and by the narratives of real people. And then I think Fred, you go back to your idea, original one which is if you use this pool. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apart from the major media companies that supported SOPA-PIPA -- leave them aside. The rest of the Internet, you say it's duty to promote the value of this Internet to the public. And you shame them into using some ad revenue, which they have anyway. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Luigi</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Zingales </span><span class="c0">No. I would like to differentiate because I think that he is very valuable to .com or .org etc., but </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there are two notice here. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One is the peer exchange and the importance of peer exchange. The other, which at least I am It is sort of a non time component element this start at a this is not unique to the Internet but the Internet is probably the most compiling case and the case resumes to so many people. But as an Internet group, I think it's useful to go outside and build a broader coalition and say, "Look, the problem is that every time we're trying sort of open up the market for competition somebody will come in and try to block us. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So let's have sort of a peer exchange and an anti- .org that tells the story on a boarder term and collect sort of a antidotes in which that a convent Really creating problem for everybody so that people can relate to it and I think it's easier 'cause the idea of a competition is good. I think it's American. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It's very sort of everybody resonates ...the of the peer economy a little bit harder to understand for most people That's my view. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Larry</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Lessig: </span><span class="c0">I'm all for more facts, more ability to take the stuff that Yochai talks about and translate it into a way that people who don't think in twelve dimensions, can understand, but I'd like to seek some very practical examples. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Would it have been enough to stop the anti-community broadband movement? Here's the crudest example of how these incumbents use their power to stop all sorts of wealth being produced in the country. &nbsp;the fact that the worst state in the nation cannot continue to have community broadband as a way to compete with incumbents, it's because, not that they didn't have to facts on the floor, that's not it wasn't because there wasn't a lot of numbers out there to show what the value here was, it was because the Republicans knew they had there was five time the amount of money coming to the legislators who supported this destruction of value has money coming to people who opposed it, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so I think you got to, you know again I want to say that is got to be No.2 in what your talking about here, [xx] has got to have No. 2 recognition here that whatever it does is going to be useless unless it also has this other part and </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Luigi</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Zin : </span><span class="c0">how many people knew about that? How many people know about that today? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see people don't know, Congressmen don't respond to people who don't know. I'm the view that money is very powerful, but it's not only money. I think that Thomas Metula's own impression. But if people don't know, they can not respond to that pressure because people don't actively create any pressure. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, that's right, that's right, if you can turn on PIPA SOPA any time we want. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span class="c0">Think about the fact that PIPA SOPA was national and it was a kind of primal fear, an unknown constraint that people reacted to. We have action being taken at the state level and at the local level, which is achieving the same effect and in fact you could look at even if it is occupied, you could look at what's happening at a hyper local level to try and you know, achieve the same effect. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">State of California. So we need to figure out a way to enlist to, as Luigi says, to make people aware, and then to translate it away from the language of intermediate liability. for lack of public wi-fi or broadband. And into what's the effect, what impact is is it going to happen, and we figure out a way to generate emergent movements in local areas that can be sustained over time, that can alert people, and and motivate people. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Fred</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Wilson: </span><span class="c0">Or national outrage. One of the things that Nick has suggested that we need and I thought this was where Clay was going to go with his volunteer fire department of the Internet, is an early warning system. Something like a Reddit, that focused only on on, you know, policy and legislative issues that effect the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where people could surface these outrageous things that are being done, providing comments, and get them propagated about the Internet, and have people sufficiently outraged about that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad: </span><span class="c0">Let's make sure that we don't already have that you could probably argue that.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Cindy Cohn: </span><span class="c0">I think that's what, I mean, maybe we're failing, but that is a lot of.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad: </span><span class="c0">Well, you are failing in terms of reaching a broader public.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Cindy Cohn:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;We're continuing to try to do that in the broader light, you're correct, I think we can be on the brighter, in terms of kind identifying early thanks to the Internet I think that the identification process is happening pretty well, you find us and a couple of groups.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Fred Wilson: </span><span class="c0">This community broadband thing, was this an issue that you we're making noise about?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We talked about being in broadband for a while, but we can't go to the state hill so.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that's the problem, then. We need not just down on the state, but we need to down on the level.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Larry</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Lessig: </span><span class="c0">That's the state level. Okay, the community broadband is about a year ago, there were literally scores of communities in North Carolina House Resolution saying, "Leave us free to build Internet." There were thousands of people that were motivated to send letters in the government and the calculation there was if she takes this on on the democrat, all the money in the world would go against her. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I am not denying, I'm not saying that's the only thing on the horizon, but if the coefficients on that variable is high enough it is the dominant thing on that environment and we've got to find a way to weaken it or undermine So that's why I'm saying that you've got to have two things on your plate, on just this one. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">JPB</span><span class="c8 c0">: </span><span class="c0">You know EFF over the course of its history has had a difficult job which was that in many cases we were aware of a problem that was coming up that was very technical, both in its technology and its it's long, and by the time we actually got a constituency together that could understand it, it was either won or lost, and that's been true all along. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We don't do what we do on the basis of broad public understanding or support, and I don't think that's ever going to be the case, that we can. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Albert</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Wenger: </span><span class="c0">and part of the problem there is that a lot of the processes leading up to these things are sort of hidden from the public. It's not like Anybody somewhere with an Internet connection can go and start researching what's in the pipeline, because the pipeline's behind closed doors, and kind of springs into action nearly fully formed. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Fred Wilson: </span><span class="c0">A good example of that is the Cyber Security legislation, or CISPA whatever its called. It had been being hatched behind closed doors for a year, and then set out on a fast track to get approved in Congress in a matter of months. And what we need to do is system, and get our moles to publish the stuff on the open Internet.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Mike</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Masnick: </span><span class="c0">But I think part of the issue is that story telling aspect here, I mean, CISPA was introduced last December, and nobody paid attention to it, in part because everyone was fighting SOPA, and that you know started spacing and then you realize that CISPA was developing that actually go to the house, but so that is have to figure out the story that actually is going to generate the attention that matters. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, the community broadband stuff, there's a lot of attention paid to...I mean, that was the latest in the of those types of fights, okay, 19 fights. And it's not always clear which you know, which story catches on. I mean, you know, I think actually one of the reasons why the SOPA fight was so was that we had people like Tiffiniy's group coming up with the way to frame that, that really caught the public's attention. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but as much credit to you guys in coming up with that. I don't know if you knew when you were coming up with the way to frame those things that it was going to catch on to the - I don't think anyone thought it was going to catch on to the level that it did. So you can come up with things, and maybe don't call them from intermediary liability because we all know that that's terrible but you can think you have the best way to frame an issue and the public might just not care, and then somebody else comes up with a different frame it, and it catches on like wildfire. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It's really tough to predict. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span class="c0">So, I heard Tiffiniy say earlier that we should have lots of these, right? That we there should be one organization, thats right we should be using networks right, hahahaha theres probably one frenick and i rememeber the free beaver. I think was as good as anything for catching a meme and propagate it and so the question is how do we generate lots and lots and lots of Fight for the Futures, even ones in South Carolina or North Carolina, wherever we lost that last battle or in California with, you know, the new initiative around copyright. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where Can we generate something at a local level that will actually propagate virally at a local level. Well, what can we do to further that? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Wendy</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Seltzer: </span><span class="c0">So, can we they make it rewarding for people to be participating in these campaigns, even if they're not advancing the idea that ultimately captures fire? Can we make it fun to be participating in the meme generation, even if their not succeeding in it? Rediff and other sites do that. That's what people say. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mike Masnick: </span><span class="c0">That’s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;what the Internet does well -- It does, and generate and propagate means, right? And so what I think we are saying more, and love to get involved in these memes and the question is, how do we direct the meme generation, right, to some extent. And it's [some of these communities, in fact like, you know, you see these things pop out at 4chan. &nbsp;Where like, you know, they figure out a way to by using that network that the one that catches on. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad Burnham: </span><span class="c0">Maybe if we could get everyone on 4chan to focus on community broadband then or anything actually. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Tim</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;O’Reilly: </span><span class="c0">Mike said something interesting and important, I think, that the Internet is good at propagating memes. One thing that I would pick up and throw into the conversation </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it strikes me that one of the things that we might think more about are, how do you ridicule things that are bad? Definitely. How do you, you know, create, sort of, awareness through, you know, things that are But there also needs to be a support structure for the meems that get generated from the network that really works to our cause. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Tiffiniy Cheng: </span><span class="c0">We need a support structure for the memes that get generated from network, that really work to our cost.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Brad Burnham: </span><span class="c0">How is that? What do you mean by that?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Tiffiniy Cheng: </span><span class="c0">So like if there's a mean that comes out of Reddit or you know, at the local estate. Imagine the reprise yeah and you know DFF and everyone else in this room can support that name and you know to push against some bad bill, there are opportunities to work with the Internet that is creating means and we also can create memes and test them. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So like if there is that comes out of Reddit or at the local state. Imagine there were a prize. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, you know if EFF and everyone else in this room can support that mean and use it to push against some bad bill. Or there are opportunities to work with the Internet that is creating these and we also are creating these.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Tim O’Reilly:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;In San Francisco got elected because of the To Legit To Quit video. You know what I mean. It's very scary. it was a great video but I think there are two things though that, the first thing is I mean, I like the idea of a meme prize and a lot of these ideas there was a layer of hard work in figuring out what the hell was going on. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Cindy</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Cohn: </span><span class="c0">I think there are two things, though, that I mean, the first thing is. I mean, I like the idea prizes, and a lot of these ideas. I would say that there's a layer of hard work in figuring out what the hell is going on. It kind of needs people who do it a lot, in order to do it, and so I'm sorry, I'm just doing the EFF line</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you need people who actually. It kinda needs people that do it a lot in order to do it so I sorry I'm just doing but you need people who actually will read the bill. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Nick Grossman: </span><span class="c0">And what we have now which I think is a huge opportunity is a there are a number of people in the middle, so the people in this room, people who kind of care? So there were probably even ten times as many people who were curious to figure out what CISPA was as their time will right but you need a lead tf so the person at dff who's been, no so i can just lay this out because </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Cindy</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Cohn: </span><span class="c0">just let me do this whole thing you need somebody and Lee Tein is the person at EFF that's been talking about modeling the cyber security bill for years. Talking about them and blogging about them. He's the person that went to our people and said this is important enough, we need to do it. So you need that person, and then you need the people on the other side, which a good example, since of course they got a cease &amp; desist of this firm Justin Bieber's people and then you know, somebody has to go no go away. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Mike</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Masnick:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I think that's powerful and I think that's part of [xx]. I don't think it's necessarily [xx] enough. In the SOPA PIPA fight, part of the reason why work was that it was the sort of coalition that came together was this odd coalition of the people who really understood this stuff, which was you guys PK and CDT who totally and completely understood this. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I kind of go back to like in critical base layer and what you have now, which I think is a huge opportunity is a broader number of people in the middle, so like, people in this room, people on Reddit who like kind of care. So like there's probably ten times as many people who were curious to figure out what Cisco was at a certain time. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We're probably willing to like make media on top of Cisco than the equivalent time six months or so like.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then you had, and I don't mean this in the negative way that it sounds, so this naive userbase that saw that information and said you know this is ridiculous this can't pass whereas, I mean, those of us who have gone through this before, it was said before that we lost for 20 years. I think kind of came into that fight thinking, we're going to make a noise and then we're gonna lose because that's what we always do. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and, you know, this was partly my view coming into it even as well,but then the folks that read it you know effectively took that that's it? No, we have to win this, we will win this. And it was that sort of mix of the people who sort of understand the process with the people who said we can't lose this even though those who understood the process thought we were going to lose it. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That made it so that we won. So you need that combination [xx] the anti </span><span class="c0">hollywood</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;right. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Tiffiniy</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Cheng: </span><span class="c0">The problem is that the media and the MPAA are rewriting history and the SOPA and PIPA fight was about, and we don't all as a part of our understanding of the SOPA/PIPA fight know all the little things and all the expertise in all the different parts that made that fight really dynamic and really powerful. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fact that we had tech entrepenuers going to congress the fact that people were on the ground organizing the protest all of that added up to something that scared congress, but it was because we had all those pieces. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Andy</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;Weissman: &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">the thing that I worry about in the SOPA and PIPA fight it took Google and Wikipedia to blackout to push it over the edge, right, it had to be that important, right? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because then what happened was the politicians' kids understood, right? Right? No, I mean, I know my came home from school that day, she's like, it's going to be a blackout day, this whole [xx[ thing is crazy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know that they kind of blacked out with a big splash with all the groceries. But is that blackout necessary? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Will that blackout occur or [xx]? No it has to be a different action</span><span>, its. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70#" name="id.446owqmz5fon"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c25">Mark</span><span class="c8 c25">&nbsp;Surman:</span><span class="c8 c25">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">I think this piece about the naive users and kinda expertise is really critical and one of the things Clay talked about before companies like Etsy being in the business of making their users smarter. And I guess that's a thing we haven't talked at all about is, you know, there is this huge constituency of people who have that the people who did say this can't happen. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">And I think, you know, we needed a lot to do these things, I mean, especially interested in doing the metrics stuff, and I am interested in the Internet pledge. But it seems to me, if we kind of believe what we all say we believe, like, those people are pretty critical to this and we're not talking about them. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">And so, you know, a concrete thing we're doing to, you know, contribute to this, I think more people should be doing, is, how do you take the fact that those people sort of have a maker spirit it or some connection to the net or whatever you want to call it, engage them around that all the time as a way to get into them becoming smarter about this stuff. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">Not as an advocacy process, but because that's why they're here on the Internet. And I think, you know, that's where in the environmental example, I go back to The Sierra Club or Scouting. If you look at Scouting, here's this. Nobody ever thought we were going to teach urban young people to camp. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">Alright? This is something that the military only did. And you know why did the come out? They didn't come out to be better citizens. and walk grandma across the street or learn about the environment. Here's a fun thing to do. Well guess what we have a lot of fun things to do like we're all in that business. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">How do you use that and create an identity around these abstractions that we have here so that people using Etsy or using using AirBnB or whatever, start to understand the mechanics of what's going on a little bit more, See themselves as a part of something bigger, not for advocacy reasons, because then the obvious reasons, even [xx] town, they see they're plugged into something. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15">And right now, like, forget the politicians, although we can't -- the people who we see as the network don't have this narrative. And I think that's not that far away. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Brad</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Burnham: </span><span>So that was a great summary of of a number of important issues that we talked about today. We have about half an hour left, and its not that we rented the room we rent the room that long term, but we did rent the equipment. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So we have a hard stop at 5 o'clock, which is about half an hour from now, and Mark because you started off so well with summarizing a whole series of points that I think we all need to consider, I'd like to just keep going right around the room and give everybody a chance to reflect on the thing that they would most like to see come out of this conversation and the action items that we need to take forward and Jeff. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Let me just say one thing I hear you talk so the thing view which we would love you to be able to pitch on. What bills are scouting movements on the Internet and so that's kinda our piece on the table is very concretely about people teaching each other How the Internet works, and how did it go? One, continuing the discussion about the principals of the society we're trying to build. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Principals of public-ness and the tool that enabled Two, on a more tactical level, I would second what both Yohea and Tim said in that corner. The pledge and what goes around that was that. well, three. Fred's media campaign and then I think what goes into that media campaign is what Tim proposes and what proposes, that we have a narrative around the value of the Internet of what we're trying to protect here, because we're not expressing it at all well. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We assume everybody knows it. Let's I think everyone should feel they can ask a follow up question as we go around the room. My follow up question is who owns that action item. Is there - Yoki proposed the four principles, I don't know if four is magic, but, and Tim proposed the narrative Mark proposed the scouting movement. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>All right, well, I propose this back, which is to thank you for doing today the wonderful thing about doing something good is you do more. So, I would propose that you push this group to come back on date future to identify exactly those action items, and exactly those [xx]. So I think in the case of Tim, it's what Fred said, there's a there's an organization that does research. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There's a RFP for that research from a foundation level or there's a proposal for that research from the group's level. There's the creation of the group called Pure Economy.org, whatever it is, right? Sorry, it's been domain [xx] since 2005. There's a budget item to buy it. There's that, there's a chance to create an organization that decides to get the research done and figures out how to get that done and find the money to get that done. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I'd say the pledge is a matter of an expression and sounds like a [xx] to me. And that I think, Fred, you're on to something with the media campaign and I think that will be a second phase. We have this narrative, we have this campaign started, now we've got to place it in [xx]. So we do have a mailing list for this group, that you've all I hope received emails on, and I'm sensitive to the idea that we ask this group to come back together. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Tiffiniy doesn't want to send more that 10 emails. I think the last time we asked a few of these folks to get together was 2 or 3 years ago, and that's about the interval I feel comfortable asking people to do this. Let's just, perhaps, keep it don't put that email into your spam folder immediately. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Maybe we can follow up with each other a little bit on a couple of these initiatives. Graham . I think something I'm reminded of here, I've been told this before, but technology companies are really anemic in the lobbying department a lot of them don't believe in the law being in some sense, but they're are kind of a designated representatives as a certain view of that should be done we should do as a said to be more prosperous and because they're adapting to to not be at all, it's doing a lot of damage. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So there really should be some kind of probably unified lobbying efforts among of dot com companies, of which there are several very large ones, to try and actually start having some influence directly in politics, which isn't happening right now. And not just sort of like the one off thing that happened with SOPA. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Tim looks like he's ducking out before he has to get called on. Any any words? Any parting words? No, I think it's going in a good direction. You'll help with the narrative? Yes, definitely. Thank you. request for help [xx] teachers. I think that Mike had this comment that you need two things. You need the people that actually know what is going on the EFF public knowledge and engine advocacy is that what you're calling? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yeah. Engine advocacy let's say there's a dozen of those organizations right? We need to light them up as a network and we need to have the people who hand out at Reddit and just hang out in blogs and care about this stuff, engage in that network. In other words, None of these organizations are behaving like an Internet system. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>They're not behaving like a Reddit, they're not behaving like a Hacker News or something like that. And that's why Nick's idea of an early warning system appealed to me. It's not that EFF isn't doing that job and it's not that public knowledge isn't doing job but they are not doing it in a way that's amplified through an Internet network that's available as a media like property, that people could respond to and engage with I think that something like that could be really powerful. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yeah, a couple things. One, I don't think we should forget about the existing legacy media ecosystems [xx] because, you know, Arab Spring doesn't happen without Al Jazeera in some way. It doesn't happen without Facebook, but also doesn't happen without that. So the bad thing is that news loves low probability, high impact events, and it doesn't really cover slow-moving disasters. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>a lot of these things are slow moving disasters. So figuring out a way to gem those up I think are important. And then the other thing that we didn't talk too much about, but is something that is a bid deal. What I'm thinking about is Iran Mobile. Missions that were two years for most of the traffic that we access going through mobile, and that's a lot different thing than the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Because right now I can start up Brad's news.com and no one can stop me. If I want to do that through even Apple Icam. So, we didn't really talk about what that means and also the rise of big data that comes out of that, that affects a close loop by a few oligarchies, then that's a whole other system going on. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So, that would be the other thing I'd say that I didn't hear today, that is something that is a data point, I think. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think it's important for all of what we are trying to do to try to elevate the Internet as a political issue and I think we have an election year this year to try to do that. I think the pledge fits into that. I think a lot of what everybody is talking about fits into that. I think it would do us a lot of good to actually politicize people or activate them or work with them over something that they care care about deeply. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And then also I want to follow up on the earlier conversation about - I don't think that any of and i think everyone is excited to figure out where there are pockets of interesting power to you use in the fights we want to take on and I think that is with the Internet, you know, there's Google, there's Etsy, there's all different kinds of community, there's young people, there's old people. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And whatever fight we're taking on, there's interest and power structures we can use use to our advantage and I think we could work together in the future in whatever coalition to make the most of the powers that we have. Can you make that a little less abstracted in the sense of where should we be looking for these power structures. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>you actually about. Well like with the system, I mean, you know, we've talked by email before about taxi drivers and how they feel like they should have the power to. Be a part of a different service that works better for consumers or for writers and we should leverage their their need or interest in having that power to fight back that policy that doesn't allow them to have that power the actor at the edge, the driver in the car as opposed to the owner of the medallion and what the driver's interest is verses the owners interest is and i think that's true as the creator of a patent, and what critters trying to do, its true being able to throw the title where the individual users want to store their data. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>If we broadly think about how to make sure those voices are heard and empowered and feel enfranchised enough to engage, then we're going to be better off. Ya, Holmes and I talked a lot, or we came up with the realization that we're actually fighting with the little guy i means it sounds like these old fights but its true for the Internet, without the little guy really so something, one, just a quick point in terms of like trying to make the The differential art of knowledge is what we speaks more and better than ever That is part of the goal of adventure or should we not there yet and I'm hoping, and there's definitely a push to get them to be able to do those kinds of things. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But then in terms of specific action items or things like that, what I was going to it was actually sort of kinda listing out general actually talking about action items for myself at least. Assign myself action items on record so that I can get in trouble when they don't fulfull one is the issue that Tim brought up in terms of like getting an actual research and hard data on what the hidden economy is and We've started to do some of that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We released a report a couple of months ago called The Sky is Rising, which really looked at the data of what's really happening industry and showing how much massive growth there is in all sorts of areas around the content industry. And that report is already having an impact especially in Europe. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I just got back from Europe and we were there presenting it in relation to the fight for ACTA and it was having a people were really really responding to it. So we are already doing more research around it. That was very narrow part, but we want to do a lot more and actually a big part of our plan for this is to be releasing more research on that front. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>For anyone in our group who does have money, research does cost money. And then the other part is the story teller. I mean a lot of what i do is try to get these stories out there in all different ways. And looking for the interesting and compelling stories, whether they're the good stories or the bad stories. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think we need that combination, you know that paints the bigger picture as well, continue look for those stories been able to present those stories in to kind of figure out what resonates. I mean part of this is that it's an experiment. We don't know what resonates. We see something that we think is crazy and I'll write a worry about it and nobody care. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so I'm wrong, but sometimes I write a story and I think nobody's gonna care and then it turns into something huge. And so A lot of that is just kind of a learning curve. So, you know, for me it's just sort of continuing to find those stories and present them and figure out, you know, what does resonate, what does go over well. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So I think that one of the big issues is the early warning system and understanding what's going on in government. I'm part of an environmental organization here in New York that looks at everything that is done in Albany and relate and evaluates it based on its impact on the environment I think one of the problems we've seen in the last 6 to 12 months is that we're often caught flatfooted in terms of what's going on in government. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>and I think that having a more effective early warning system. Research does cost money, and I think it does require funding. I think we should be putting resources into understanding what's going on in the government. We have to more proactive, not only responsive in terms of reacting to legislation, but also boots on the ground figuring out what's gurgling underneath. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I'm a little bit more optimistic than maybe Naomi in terms of the ability to - once we understand what's going on, the ability to bring to bear resources to try and change things in an effective way. So I think a lot of our initial effort, and some of this is being done today with the existing organizations, which I think probably require higher profile more support then we're currently getting because we do have boots on to some extent I think I don't know this question, communication or visibility or what have you but I think that should be an So, that's fine. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So the first wish I have is that we pick and choose that we do all the things we said so far. Yes. Hear, hear. And then I think there's energy and enthusiasm in everyone to each do his highest and best if we all mobilize something that works to work with to do each of the things we talked about it will be a very good outcome. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So I would say we have a set of things that are about changing policy. a set of things that are about changing how we make policy that we've talked about. And on the side of changing policy I want to, it's not second, it's fifth or eighth at this point, the emphasis on narrative, on stories, on talking about economic impact, things that can be delivered in sound bytes that resonate for people and that focus on the lives of real people and how their, around vertical issues. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>How it helps with the environment, with crime, safer communities, better education, the less we talk about the horizontal in the process, the less we talk about the Internet or government, frankly, this is the lessons we learned in trying to do open government. The less you talk about open government and the more you talk about safer communities, educating your children, creating jobs, you know, generating entrepreneurship. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Again, one has to do both, but I think that that's useful. And on the side of changing how we make policy, I think that the emphasis on institutional innovation and changing what we mean by democracy is really the bigger larger goal, so that we use the Internet as a model how we govern in this society. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so, they are the specific kind of concrete stuff around which I volunteer and would love help and want to, you know, continue the conversations, one on this issue of corporate transparency and building the tools to really try to uncover the shell game that has impacts then on issues like money in politics and our IP policy and our cyber policy and everything else. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think unless we know who's actually pulling the levers of power it becomes very difficult to affect change and it becomes very difficult to do that kind of early warning that we're talking about for government is we need those kinds of early mornings also on the corporate sides. Developing Q &amp; A systems and their use in government, so really changing what it means to participate in government. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Right now we have far to few ways for people to get involved. Voting and lobbying seems to be one of the things we've talked about .There have got to be more ways that people can do stuff to affect the life of their democracy and so that's where I think some of the new experiments are really exciting and interesting been talking, for example, with one of the USV companies called Stack Exchange around using their platform for Q &amp; A systems for getting better scientific and technical expertise and the government to give geeks another way to participate and get involved in the life of their democracy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So the last thing I'll just say is that Brad you were less [xx] than I am by suggesting only asking people to get back together every two or three years I want to...you know, this is a fabulous and energetic brain trust. I think the issues we're facing are existential, not just about the Internet but about democracy and democratic institutions and I think we ought to convene. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Maybe it's subgroups of people who are interested in one side of this issue or the other, you know, the changing policy versus the changing how we make policy as often as it takes. So for that end for those people who are interested in the changing how we make policy we have a chunk of change from McArthur and a commitment that if we come up with some good stuff to build, a commitment for a couple of million dollars over the next few years, to contextualise, what are the kinds of things we can build to really develop a new model for what democracy looks like, how we define it, what we mean by it. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So we can buy really good dinner and cool free t-shirts and the companionship of whoever wants to get together to really brainstorm about what we can do to construct or reconstruct to rethink how we make policy. Okay. Craig, and I like some of the ideas, in particular the Internet volunteer fire department and then the [xx] pledge. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Since I think also something which has good message framing and delivery, along those lines anything we do has to have good messaging and forgive me but marketing and advertising around it. That was effectively the, well, what Wikipedia and others doing for SOPA. And while we may not think of ourselves in that manner, that's the role in which we need to be i don't think we are going to need to be Don Draper but we are going to need Don Draper. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Brevity is the soul of weight. I'll add on that and I figure that we can all be done. This is Nick. I wanted to repeat some thing and echo something typically said and [xx], which is that there are lot of different things we can do and lot of things we should do and Tiffiniy's point about what made SOPA interesting and good, was that people were trying new different things in creative ways of spinning ideas and that we should keep doing that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We have a network of people that are all doing different things, and I think our job as a group should be to strengthen and amplify each others efforts. Further getting that act more like a network and continue putting out the diversity of ideas. I feel like that is very blind with the approach that we sort of have or the beliefs we have about the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So I'm thinking about how can we use the strengths of the Internet to continue to spread these messages and amplify efforts. A couple specific things I'm interested in. I'm really interested in the creative power that the Internet has, the ability for lots of people to build things or raise the floor for our activism our avid skill organizing, and I am also really interested in continuing to identify and spread the kind of citizen hacks that we're seeing like the Twitter patent thing and I think there's this idea of netizen effects where someone does something like that and it ripples through the system and I think that's really cool. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So I want to keep my eye out on that. One concrete thing that we've been kicking around as an idea that I think we're gonna run with, what if every website on the Internet added slash awesome to it and used that as a place to tell the stories about the amazing things that were happening within that community whether it's Etsy or Fred's Blog or Tumblr or whatever, and what if we could look at all that and say, you know what? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The web isn't about the Internet itself. It's about education and how Disaster relief and all these things are happening out there and we think about we need to find looking into this election season need to find the Joe the plumbers of the Internet. The real people that embody the. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;Plumbers? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>No the beauty of it is that there are thousands of them, right? And that's why I say we're all Don Draper. Like, we can't all tell the stories. We have to enable everybody else to tell the stories, and the stories are going to be very powerful. So I'm really excited about that and I want to work together to agree on that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You can go to slash awesome dot net to look at the idea for that project. [xx] hasn't really gotten through it yet but I think that will be fun and I would like to do it together. And I will commit to continuing to do what I can to work with everybody in this room and everybody not in this room or a lot of people so we can all act like a network, and these small pieces loosely joined all in support whatever a little bit I think we all have it. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So I think this was a fascinating and they follow a litlle bit on Jamie's short term long term. Two core things that I week from today one are the narrative the one that came out very early in the morning as well as in the for presentations from the companies at the beginning of the second session, was that we are seeing a transformation of both capitalism and democracy very similar lines. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>One thing we started to work and chew on and think we need more work on is the mean the capture date. Whether it's open source as Larry was suggesting because it's been so broadly used. Whether its peer networks along the line that Stephen was was pushing, but a meme that will allow us to all know where we all stand in this non-state not older-style capitalism distribute the network social model for me is important the antidotes in the story things you reported the measuring technically that Tim was focusing on, the kinds of things that Mike was doing in "Sky is Rising" and beginning to do that the narrative forming the narrative. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The interventions in basic structures of politics in the longer term Building the kind of political models of engagement ranging from the volunteer fire fighters immediate or the intermediate Internet defense league but broadening them more Broadly I think the kinds of things that open Congress is beginning to work on, with regard to creating work organization around districts is important. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think we can't forget Larry, and he's not here, we can't forget Larry's emphasis on the significance of pushing on money in politics as the second agenda item that everyone has to remember no matter what their primary agenda and with regard to the early warning system, and connecting it to Tiffiniy's point about building structures, there are the professionals who've been doing this all the time The translation might be that SOPA PIPA, the role he played in generalizing that allowing people to sort of connect both doing early warning work but also to connect with central, just, this is data and data-driven statement, not hypothesis will be presenting that work so that's very important on the "Seize the Day" on my own personal things that I - I think seizing the day on the one hand the energy from SOPA PIPA, on the other hand the focus on the fact that it's election year and trying to actually do the things in the space we are all very familiar with and the people are highly activated on the Internet I certainly will take on myself to try to nudge forward the Internet Freedom pledge and send around to see what's useful to people and I think that Fred's idea of a privately created, purpose-built, or maybe broader but trying to work on that model of the voting with dollars or Franklin's and Grant's model on advertising on exits passed in advertising is a really potential powerful act that I'd be interested in playing with if you are continuing to work on that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>[xx]. So in all the disparate threads, I'm trying in my trying to put them together towards what Craig said which was message framing or marketing them that ties it together, that makes the most sense in ordering a lot of different things. And I actually realized five minutes ago that I think you, Brad, actually had the Don Draper moment that ties it all together to me when you said, in your statement you said, the Internet is not the problem, the Internet is the solution. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And to me that feels like, something along those lines is the narrative that ties all the tactics together, that resonates very broadly. And it's a phrase I've used with a lot of people and every single time you get the same reaction. Everyone kind of shakes their head. They don't really know specifically what it means, but they know generally what it's referring to. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And to me that's the theme that ties a lot of this discussion together. So you are Don Rackobrett [sp?]? I guess someone more trained. My takeaway today is basically that we can hack Washington as long as long as the webs open but we do that in order to keep the Web open and to advance our democracy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think the type of organization that Fred's talking about is really necessary, and here's one example we talked about a lot, that PIPA SOPA. A 40 member of Congress jump on and 40 members of Congress jump off, because they didn't know what they were getting into, and they barely knew what they were getting out of. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Congress does not understand the Net it's not necessarily Congress' fault because people aren't there talking to them about the Net as much as they ought to be. Every capital. In every capital. Every capital. and that includes our embassies in other capitals too. But I think the type of organization that we need needs to be member-driven, not corporate-driven and and it has to have a political component and political agenda that city p and pk don't have for instance I think that is exactly right that we have to think about the way we govern, if we govern in a way that we like to see the Internet which is open and collaborative and trustworthy, I think we'll end up with better outcomes. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I think the type of pledge that Yohi is talking about ought to include something about the way we govern. Something about the process, not just the outcomes. We want to see the process. And then lastly I will say, we've been talking about doing some research, and you know, Senator Wyden chairs the subcommittee on trade. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>As a result, we have some resources. We've been working with the International Trade Commission. And we believe that we'll soon have a commitment for a two year process that gets them to look at the digital goods and digital services economy in the US and globally so we can start to Quantify the size of the economy in terms of contribution of the GDP and like what.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The very important that are under I'm not sure that needs to remain separate from it research effort is there something.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We can, the way it works is we go back and forth with the ITC on the request and they come up with what they cant do and we kinda negotiate with them as to what type of reports that delivered to us, where and how be covered a lot of the research they will be doing is going to be original. They'll have to do a lot of original research, questionnaires, samples, trying to figure out what because a lot of his data just isn't captured by the census by the Department of Commerce. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yeah just sticking with the way you frame the questions is going to have a lot to do with how much we get out of that investment.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>That's right.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There's a bunch of people here now who recognize now I think that we need to do research on what Tim called the clothesline problem, identifying economic benefits that are not going to be [xx] today. And I wondered if somehow we can, as a part of this group, support you in the questions that you're [xx] to that.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I can send around some of the questions that we're posing now to see if we can approve them. I feel very energized by the discussion today because there are so many different threads working threads I think that will come out of it. I'm also taking away I think more than ever that keeping the Internet open in the short term is critical, because it's the thing that's going to power most of these initiatives, and So I'm very interested in working with Yoki on the pledge but also on formulating what the single of critical principal behind it is because I'm an engineer by training, I've thought a lot about what's made Internet powerful is that simple insight at the technical level which was that the Internet was designed let people create newer networks that can talk to the existing networks, and if you take that principle from the machine level and elevate it to the people level, meaning, anything that obstructs the creation of...people creating new networks that are connected to the existing networks of people is sort of basically a thing we should look at the bad thing that's kind of in my mind become a very powerful way of phrasing what he Internet freedom thing is about. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>When they designed the Internet it was about the freedom for machines to connect to each other. Now we have that it's about the freedom of people to connect with people on top of that. Great want to Thank you for including me it's been an extraordinary conversation. You've got it all sewn up it seems to me with Fred's plan your highest pledge and the support you've got on the hill or the beginning of the conversation on the hill you got it for the [xx] [xx] in the room. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I would like to quickly say that one resource you have in the room is your own self sense that in this society I think in media terms heavy hitters are influencers and so part of your messaging now, you know, what if we Patsy Mazilla kick starter. You have the power leaving here to create a campaign and put a on your homepages that say something like "I support an open society." I mean, words like "Internet defense," they're great for your constituency, but for mainstream America I supported up in the society little friendly so whats that you know. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And then when you get critical mass [xx] expensive realistic [sp?] [xx] for I stand up for open society. What does that mean [xx] an exciting campaign that you can run for free pretty much and the last thing I want to offer is a resource which is in a couple of weeks there will be something that I hope will be used by people like cindy to connect you're constituencies to see an early warning system that will walk the Internet sorting upcoming legislation and then merge with social networks So if anyone's interested I'm happy to give you more information. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Thank you so much for including me. My organization was created in a time of political crisis. we all know what the crisis is, so I won't go into those details. What I would say is a specific thing that I would like to see, and I think this goes along with what Fred is offering and and others is a systematic and sustained investment in non-profit and for-profit organizations that are focused on disruptive politics. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And the simple goal of these organizations, and I can say this comes from a </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>[...]</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Achieve on i think we need more work on the mean that captured it, whether it is open source as Larry was suggesting because it been solid revenues. Whether its been peer networks, along the lines of the scheme was pushing for a mean that would allow us to all know where we stand for this. not older-style capitalism, distributed network, social model. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The beam is important. The anecdotes and the stories that were in the beginning that John Perry's pushing. The measuring technically Tim was focusing on the kind of things that Mike was doing. The sky is rising and beginning to do that, the narrative, forming the narrative. the interventions in basic structures of politics in the longer term building the kind of political model of engagement ranging from the one here from fibers immediate or the intermediate defense league but broadening them more groggy, I think the kinds of things that often the congress are beginning to work on with regard to creating worth of organization around of districts, of is important. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think we can forget Larry and he's not here. We can't forget Larry's emphasis on the significance of pushing on money in politics as the second agenda item, that everybody has to remember no matter what their primary agenda is. And with regard to the early warning system and connecting into Christine's point about building structures, there are the professionals who are doing this all the time, the translation might be the SOPA-PIPA, the role he played in generalizing that and allowing people to sort of connect both doing various works, but also connect was syndrome. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Just, this is data and data driven statement. Not a hypothesis. We'll be presenting that word. So that's very important. On the seize the day on my own personal things that I. I think day on the one hand energy from SOPA PIPA, on the other hand the focus on the fact that it's an election year and trying to actually do the things in the that we are all very familiar with and people are highly active with it on the Internet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I certainly will take on myself, try to nudge forward the Internet freedom pledge and and send around, to see what's useful to people. And I think that Fred's idea of a privately created purpose filled or maybe it's broader, of trying to work on that model of the voting with dollars, or [xx] of modeling on advertisement, [xx] on advertising is a really potentially powerful I'd be interested in getting your opinion to work on that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Andy. So I have a In all the disparate threads, I'm trying in my mind to put them together what Craig said, which is the market and that ties it together and that makes the most sense in ordering a lot of different things. Actually, you realize that five minutes ago that I You, Brad, actually had the Don Draper moment that ties it all together. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>we you said in your statement, 'The Internet's not the problem, it's the solution.' and to me that feels like something like never find into the narrative that ties all the tactics together and resonates very broadly and it's a phrase I've used with a lot of people. And every single time it gets a reaction. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And become specifically but more generally what it's referring to. And to me that's the theme that ties a lot of this discussion together. So you are all, right? and that's a lot of drinking my take-away today is that basically we can hack Washington as long as the web's open to that in order to keep the web open and to advance democracy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think a type of organization that Fred's talking really necessary. Here's one example we talked about a lot, the imbecile factor. 40 members of Congress jump on, and 40 members of Congress jump off Because they didn't know what they were getting into and they barely knew what they were getting out of congress is not understandable of that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It is not necessarily, congress is people aren't there talking to then about the Net as much as they ought to be. Every capital. Good point. It's not just Congress it's every capital. And there's different embassies in other capitals too. But I think the type of organization that we need, it needs to be member driven, not corporate driven, and it has to have a political [xx] became [xx] I think that Exactly right. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We have to think about the way we govern. If we govern in a way that we'd like to see the collaborative and trustworthy and have different outcomes. I think that the type of budget Johan is talking about also includes something about the way there's something about the process not just the outcome of the process and then lastly I will say in talking about the research and as you know, Senator Wyden, who chairs the subcommittee on trade. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>As a result, we have some resources, and we've been working with the international trade commission, and we believe that we'll be enough and it networks a two-year process that just stands for you and you look at just [xx] source's economy start to quantify the size of the economy [xx] contribution [xx] So can we coordinate that? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Or I'm not sure whether that needs remain separate from any research effort that we do. Is there some way that we can...? We can. The way it works is we go back and forth with the ITC on the request and they what it can do and what it can't do and try to negotiate with that incident what types of reports they can deliver to us covered. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>A lot of the research they will be doing is [xx] original [xx]. Do a lot of original research, questionnaires I am just thinking that the way we the questions is gonna have a lot to do with how much we get out of that investment. And there's a bunch of people here who recognize now I think that we need to do research on what Tim the clothesline problem, identifying the econominc benefits that are not being quantified today. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I wonder is somehow we can as part of this group support you in helping by the questions that you're feeding to that. Absolutely. I can send around some of the questions that you're posing now and see if we can accept them. I feel very energized by the discussions today because so many different interesting threads, working threads I think that are a part of it. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But I'm also taking away that keeping the Internet open in the short term is critical because it's the thing that's going to power these initiatives, and so I'm very interested. working with Yo Kai on the pledge but also on formulating what the single sort of critical principle behind it is. And because I'm an engineer by training I've thought a lot about what's making the Internet powerful is that simple insight at the technical level, which was that the Internet was designed that people create new networks that can talk to the existing networks. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>If you take that principle from the machine level and elevate it to the people level meaning anything that obstructs the creation of people train new networks that are connected to the existing networks and people basically we should look it that way. That's the in my mind it's become a very powerful way of phrasing what the Internet freedom thing is about. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>When they designed the Internet it was about the freedom for machines to connect with each other Now that we have that its about people [xx] [xx]. I just want to thank you for everything extraordinary conversation you've got to also know, it seems to me. You know, on the hill or the [xx] station you got it covered and the ratios. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I'd like to quickly say that one resourcing haven't really step on themselves, instead that in this society if the media turns heavy hitters or boosters and So, now that you're messaging now, you can work on that Etsy, Mozilla, Kickstarter. You have the power to create a [xx] homepages that say something like [xx] society. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I mean, words like Internet defense are great for your constituency mainstream America I support an open society [xx] leaders and what's that. What you get is critical mass of if answers at the expense of standing for, I stand up for an open society. What does that mean? And that's an exciting [xx] and the last thing I want to offer is a resource which in a of couple of weeks, there will be something that I hope can be used by people like Cindy to connect [xx] an early warning system that will walk the Internet sorting upcoming legislation and then merge with social networks so [xx] My organization was created in a time of political crisis. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We all know what the crisis is, so I won't go into that when I would say a specific thing that I would like to see [xx] from the credit he is offering and others systematic and sustained investment in non-profit and profit organizations that are focused on distruptive and the simple goal of these organizations, and I can say this coming from a point of hope, and participating in an organization that had millions of people activated one way or another, either on the Net or in terms of getting an organization on the ballot. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>What I've found is that there are a lot of people starting a lot of things, that sit outside of the normal political process. And that is the healthy pressure that I'm talking about being placed lawmakers and representatives. And those organizations in the main are just focused on changing the relationship between citizens and the representatives, who represent us in Government. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>That's not going to stop, and they're young, and they're smart and they are very well-educated, and they are under-mentored and under-resourced. Over the next couple of years I'd like to change that, and I may be calling on some of you to give advice and counsel. don't know how to do that very well. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I'm going to say something now that might not be that popular. And that is that as we look at the fight, the SOPA fight, that may represent a huge victory for the community, and it does. and people should be extraordinarily proud of it, but it unfortunately may also represent a failure of what I think Naomi was trying to get across that may not have been heard, it got caught up in lot of the conversation. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>By the time you get to the point where a piece of legislation is so bad and contorted that you have to call out the fire department, which is a good idea, to kill it. Many people in other industries would think you've already failed. And and if you guys actually think about how you feel about drunk driving, and how you feel about smoking, causes cancer, drunk driving causes death and other bad things. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Organizations like mother's against drunk driving have organized your mind's to think about those things in a certain way that's effective. So everybody entering politics, everybody entering the practice of actually making laws and legislation is anchored in a certain understanding about those two issues. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I would argue if somebody comes from a political environment who finds himself accidentally running a technology company. That what you've got to do is frame this in a way that is extraordinarily sharp and powerful. So that the people who are sitting in those seats, instead of the dynamic being you want to influence them through lobbying, they actually have to start with a base DNA level understanding of why it is important to have an open and free Internet, and what that has to do with democracy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>If you don't have it down to that base level then you're always going to be calling out your fire department. Understand that it is possible because when I said 'drunk driving' and when I said 'smoking', all of you have a baseline understanding of how you feel about them, whether or not you drive and smoke here thank you very much </span></p><p class="c1"><span>what somebody else thank you very much for invitation. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I appreciate it. Thank you. So I want to take just a couple of things. One is that in our efforts we try to be Internet-y all the way down. And that means being participatory and edge controlled and networked, and thinking of ways to nudge the network but not thinking that we can direct the network or manage the network, at best, we can be leaders who encourage by following the good ideas that come from elsewhere in the network. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I think we can also go help that network to do norms education [xx] to educate others about what the network means to them whether that's users of somebodys open system systems, and also our political leaders who may not have used the systems yet but can be shown how they work and how debating in an open source project or in an open moderated wiki works so that they better appreciate it, and then I think we can also work with the technologies that exist. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I work with the Tor project which is a peer produced anonymity technology technology and censorship circumvention, bringing some of these edge communication powers to people in both here and then other more repressive societies so that they can communicate securely, one to another and demonstrating their ethics of privacy by design, relying on the security of peer-reviewed code rather than promises to engage those. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You know, it's funny, when I talked to Tim about what this meeting was going to be, I had an even more grandiose notion of what we were going to try to do here, which was to start really engaging in theoretical and possibly not so theoretical discussion of what the economics of information would look like if we got beyond property as a way of monetizing expression. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And that's a chunk, but it also struck me as something that's going to actually have to happen, or we're going to go on fighting this battle for a long time, and you know I don't want to fight this battle for a long time. But we'll save that grand objective for another day I reckon. What I get from this is first of all that we have the same cultural problem that the environmental movement did, and we have to start attacking it in the way that some of the environmental movement did, and realize that in many ways fighting class warfare by another name. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Only our class is geek class, and we like the geek class. I've given up on trying to make EFF anything other than a geeky organization. I used to get really fancy people to come to the birthday parties, and I decided it wasn't worth it. But, you know, we need to have better for communications with folks who aren't geeks, because they have the same issues at stake that we do and we have to think about the the multitude of small businesses that are active on eBay, that have a very strong interest in the Internet and have logo relationships with their officials. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We need to crowdsource which we ought to be able to do if we think about it. And, you know, I had a funny...I don't even know whether to mention this I have a wealthy young friend who knows a lot about viral marketing, and I went over to his place last week at one point and I said "Well, you know, you've got a lot money that I heard that was cool, but what are you doing for a purpose in life? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And he said well I'm thinking a lot about politics. And I said what, running for office? I and he said no, I'm thinking about how to gamify real world politics so that you build cred by going door to door. and that you amplify FourSquare in some way that you have a network of networks that can automatically take what has been much too global back down to the local. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I think that's actually, you know, I don't want to reveal too much of what he was thinking, 'cause I Probably figure out some way to turn it into a business, but I think there's something there, and we can do that. and we are going to have to do it, or we will lose this unbelievable opportunity for humanity which is you know an irreplaceable thing, and we can give it away for some very short term reasons.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Mark Reckler apologize for having to step out here. I appreciate being here, first of all. One of the things that I most appreciate about today's what I didn't hear, which was, I didn't hear a lot of what I would describe as ideology, or what I would normally describe as politics. I spend my life in the political world, and what I've seen is that the country's being destroyed by divisive ideology and divisive politics and those things are being used against citizen. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Most people, at least in this country, understand that, actually. Three years ago I would have spoken very differently. I would have been very cynical about this country and our prospects. I would have told you that the American people aren't all that bright, they're not engaged. They don't really care. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I spent the last three years traveling all over the country from little town to New York City you know from the North East down to the South West, and what I found is extraordinary people in every town I go to, whether its a small town or a big city, in all different kinds of settings professional, rural, it doesn't matter. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Universities, extraordinary people with extraordinary ideas are looking for ways to implement those ideas. And, to me The power of the network and what's being talked about here is the idea that people can plug in to the network. They can be part of the network and can contribute, and they can pull things out of the network. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>so anything that we can do to foster that and always for me focusing on the people, average people out there who have the opportunity to plug in. From my perspective that needs to be bottom up, because that's where the wisdom is in our society. The further away people get from the bottom the less wisdom I so. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so my personal fight is to continue to fight to decentralize, and John hit it before I got to, which is going back to communities. This is how this country was founded and one of the great things about country's people governed themselves at the community level. They understood their own problems because they lived them day in and day out. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>They understood how to solve those problems, and frankly, even if they were not great at solving them, the feedback loop was so dramatic and almost instantaneously that they could adjust on the fly. And we've nationally stateized, nationalized, globalized, everything, in my opinion, to such a great degree that the feedback loop is broken. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>the feedback loop works best at the local level. And I don't trust folks at the national level. I trust folks at the local level. Wherever they are, whatever their or whatever their ideology is at the local level, they seem to do a pretty good job. And the polls bear that out, you know. Seventy percent of Americans trust their local government an extraordinarily high number in this day and age. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Currently 6% of Americans say that Congress is doing a fair or good job. and they're delusioned. That's Congress and their relatives. okay? First of all, Luigi [xx]. Thank you for having me here. This was a lot of fun. I will try to be brief since we are over time. What did I take out of this fantastic day, two things that I think I got, and I think we got, you know was the important one that I wish we had done more. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>May be its for the next time so the two things we've got, number one the idea that is a modification by Larry, idea by Fred and Steve, but idea that is sort of an Internet superPAC available in the form of political advertising for candidates that opt out of the system. I think it's a great idea. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It's kind of a private market solution to the constitutional convention of Lessig, and as such it's not an alternative, but it goes in the right direction. I think this can really change the political game in a sort of for the [xx]. So I think this is a great idea. In my view also sort of this idea of broadening the sort of appeal, be it with sort of the some key points or other things I think is extremely important. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The part that I wish we would discuss more is the data issue. I think that Internet is great, however, some people get to know a lot, actually much more we know about what's south. There was this start up it was told to me - I think that was a New York Times. Of a father who He's upset with Target because his 17 year old daughter received an ad for a pregnant lady and so She's seventeen. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>She's not pregnant. And then a few months later, sort of, he apologized to [xx] because she was pregnant. She didn't know. He didn't know. But she didn't know either. [xx] know simply because they figure out when women get pregnant they change the pattern of scent they like. So they have a statistical model, and [xx] statistical model of somebody that so this is the level of knowledge that people have about us that we don't have and I think that That's a big important fight, there are big differences between parliamentary in Europe and parliamentary in the United States and that sort of the new frontier, I think of SOPA PIPA that we should sort of fight and we should be prepared for that. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I'm going to yield my time to Cindy. Oh my, okay. This was great and exciting. Thank you very much for including me in this. I think that we've been talking levelly today about stuff that I get to think about all the time. And EFF will continue its work. I do want to make a couple of points. First is that at least and I think the effect as a whole. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We're in this to grow a movement, not just an organization, so we try to be really good partners with everybody else, and we will continue to do that. In terms of the early warning system, there's far too few of us trying to do this and there are far too many issues, so anything we can do that can the movement would be great. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>A couple things that we're kicking around, that we'd like to do. One of them is I call it SpeakTech to power, like speaking of tech. Right Greg? And continuing to represent people, a number of people in this room have been my client it's really high which is I thought we agreed never to talk about that?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But it's SpeakTech to power which is to try to get more people who are passionate about technology which is kind of our community better able to speak to people in power. And we're kind of kicking around ideas about how to get a better educated kind of geek class who can talk to non-geeks without the non-geeks feeling like they're really stupid.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We also need rednecks for open source.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Well. But I think what we're building here is a network to protect networks, and I think that's great. And again we have specific skills. We are not really, fundamentally, a D.C. policy shop. I'm much more staff up in terms of the court system. We didn't talk about the other two branches because of government very much today, but I just want to throw them in, because a lot of the things that we want to accomplish, we might not need to fix congress to do. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I don't mean that we don't try to fix Congress, but the Constitution is our friend and we should develop it and that happens much more in the courts. So, if EFF is going to continue doing everything the EFF does, there's a whole marketing activist part of the EFF that I'm not really in charge of, but continuing to try to figure out as many ways as possible to engage both our community and the bigger community. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I'm excited to see what comes out of this, this meeting in terms of proposals. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Thank you. Jamie, will you take us out? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I will be. Of all the things, I guess one thing I haven't mentioned - which some people in this room have done but I know a lot have not - I found that an enormously effective and underrated thing, particularly by people in this room, is writing for dead tree legacy media i.e. newspapers. The people to many of the people that we want to reach still read newspapers even if they read them online, and they do think that it matters whether [xx] Times or the Financial Times or the Wall Street Journal that is covering their content. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Many of the people in this room write very well, although it's a completely different medium to write in 850 word chunks and to write completely understandably and to write in a way that gets a lot of attention and promote it. I had experience recently working with the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property in the UK, which was prompted by an anecdote parties complete review of UK IP Policy. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The anecdote was the two founders of Google telling David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, that they could never have offended this country because because they didn't have the protections they have in the United States. The protections like they are used. The protections like 512, the protections like 230. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And then he said, "Well, let's do a review and see if we need all those things." of that came a review, which I invite you to look at. It actually has ten astoundingly good ideas. I had hoped to get one in. and it has 10 and the UK government has just accepted it. I asked the staff how on Earth this process happened and what influenced it. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And I asked them to be candid, what was most influential in terms of getting policymakers to think differently and getting the staffers to bring people in. The thing that they mentioned most was that basically I and others have been writing articles in the Financial Times, which is basically the British monied classes talking to themselves. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And if they can come to the Financial Times and it says things like competition, it says openness and innovation, over time that breeds a certain degree of...A lot of times we assume we can't influence policy because we assume we can't reach and change people's framework. That's not true. we had mentioned this today. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It's a very non-Internet thing to end on, but I say: write some Op-eds and send them in. It's oped@newyorktimes.com and they and I will say no.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Thank you all.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Thank you.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Thank you. That's a wrap! Bye. Long day. A lot of sitting. Yeah, that's for sure. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p></div><div id="footer"><span>Közzétéve a <a target="_blank" title="Learn more about Google Drive" href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Drive-on</a></span><span class="dash">–</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/abuse?id=19W7G0qjfpFL-Zy448mW96yF52HEwknsNdH4_LBU8U70">Visszaélés jelentése</a><span class="dash">–</span><span>5 percenként automatikusan frissítve</span></div><script type="text/javascript">
